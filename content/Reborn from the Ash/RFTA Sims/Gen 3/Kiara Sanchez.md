**Kiara Sanchez** is the protagonist of the first chapter of [[Reborn from the Ash]]. She's the daughter of [[Antonio Sanchez|Antonio]] and [[Jacqueline Sanchez]], and was raised to inherit their family fortune and business.

## Profile

> Jacqueline reads to Kiara.

Born into wealth and privilege, Kiara was raised to inherit the Sanchez family fortune and business. She grew up incredibly sheltered, rarely every getting the opportunity to go out in public, and was also waited on hand and foot by a vast array of personal servants. Kiara's father, [[Antonio Sanchez|Antonio]], taught her about her responsibilities and future role, while her mother, [[Jacqueline Sanchez|Jacqueline]], showed her the finer things in life, such as designer clothes, fancy meals, and the vast treasure trove of knowledge they had in the personal library. For a time, Jacqueline was Kiara's only friend.

When she was a teenager, Antonio entered a business partnership with the Villareal family. He allowed Kiara to spend time at the [[Villareal Estate]] where she became fast friends with [[Luna Villareal]], who was around the same age. They bonded over their growing distaste for their respective families and fears that if they stayed, they'd become just like their parents. The two of them eventually tried to run away, but they were caught and ratted out by Luna's little brother, [[Max Villareal|Max]]. Kiara's freedom to visit the Villareal Estate was significantly more limited from that day forward.

> Kiara announces her departure.

Kiara sullenly followed in her parents footsteps for many years to follow; learning business tactics from Antonio and making appearances at Jacqueline's lavish parties. She argued with Jacqueline constantly, and one day, something within her snapped. She stormed out into town and felt as if she was in an 'authentic' space for the first time in 20-some years. When she was brought back by [[Lyric Jarrel]], her personal servant, it hit Kiara that she had no real life experiences. Her perfect life had never afforded her any and her parents had raised her to be shallow, self-absorbed, and inauthentic. She blamed her parents for everything. That night, after a brief discussion with Lyric, Kiara rose to her feet at family dinner and announced that she was leaving. Antonio agreed rather readily, and even offered to fund the experience, confident that she'd be back.

> Kiara meets her new neighbors.

On the day Kiara left, Antonio presented her with the keys to [[Kiara's House|a house]] he'd picked out for her personally despite Kiara's protests. The house was unimpressive, and she was robbed within minutes of getting there, but Kiara was determined. She went and met her neighbors, two women named [[Libby Honeycutt]] and [[Houda Choukri]] who were with their friend [[Fatima Mansouri]].  Kiara introduced the the three of them to Luna and Lyric, wanting for people from both versions of her life to connect.

## Personality
Kiara was raised with incredible privilege, and it shows. Much of what she does is in her own self-interest- from running away with [[Luna Villareal|Luna]], to leaving the [[Sanchez Mansion|mansion]], or even connecting her neighbors with her friends from her previous life. Her sheltered upbringing also led to a certain degree of obliviousness with her having a horrible understanding of how shops and restaurants work and how to avoid getting robbed. She also speaks incredibly formally and dresses like a princess.

Luckily, Kiara does have some degree of awareness of her privilege. She doesn't catch all of it, but she notices some, and she desperately wants to improve. [[Lyric Jarrel|Lyric]] had been just a servant to her for years, and Kiara realized that it wasn't right or fair to think of another person that way. Still, she has a tendency to direct the blame for being that way outward, towards [[Antonio Sanchez|Antonio]] and [[Jacqueline Sanchez|Jacqueline]] and their 'poison' rather than looking inward.
