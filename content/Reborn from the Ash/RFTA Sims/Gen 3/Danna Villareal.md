**Danna Villareal** is a character mentioned in the first chapter of [[Reborn from the Ash]]. She's the wife of [[Jacques Villareal|Jacques]].

## Profile
Danna married [[Jacques Villareal|Jacques]] long before he was one of the wealthiest men in [[Windenburg]], but that doesn't mean she disliked money. Far from it. She celebrated Jacques's financial success, and her joy in his success likely played a large role in Jacques continuing to invest in property and eventually working with [[Antonio Sanchez]]. The pair of them gave birth to [[Hugo Villareal|Hugo]], then moved expanded Jacques's childhood home into the [[Villareal Estate]], where [[Luna Villareal|Luna]] and [[Max Villareal|Max]] were born.

> Danna gives advice to Max.

As Jacques became increasingly buried in his work, Danna began to feel rather distant from him, and it was something that bothered her. The man who'd once wanted to share everything with her was suddenly keeping secrets. He shared more with Hugo than her. Embittered, Danna bonded with Max over being left out of family secrets, and she advised him on how to command a room.

One day, Danna disappeared without a trace. It was news that shook all of Windenburg. While some blamed Jacques, the mystery of what happened to Danna was never solved.

## Personality
Danna loves fine things and money, but she also has a great deal of love for [[Jacques Villareal|Jacques]] and her children. Being iced out of Jacques's business proceedings wounded Danna deeply, and she wanted nothing more than to force her way into being a part of things with her husband again.
