The **Villareal Estate** is a location in [[Reborn from the Ash]]. Located on the [[Windenburg]] Island, it's the home of [[Jacques Villareal]] and his family.

## Profile
Located on a private island, the Villareal Estate features the childhood home of [[Jacques Villareal]] and the surrounding land he purchased and built up for himself, his wife, [[Danna Villareal|Danna]], and their son, [[Hugo Villareal|Hugo]]. The estate grew as his family and wealth did, eventually even featuring its own private [[Villareal Mausoleum|mausoleum]] for himself and his later scions. As Jacques became increasingly consumed by his work with [[Antonio Sanchez]], Danna drew up plans to improve the estate. Jacques refused any changes to his childhood home, but okayed plans to the grounds that Danna was unable to implement before her disappearance.

After Jacques's passing, Hugo struggled with the upkeep, and the house began to feel rather dated. He still upheld Jacques's wish of no major changes to the house itself, but he allowed [[Luna Villareal|Luna]] to implement Danna's plans for the grounds in her memory. Hugo allowed his younger brother, [[Max Villareal|Max]], to do what he wished with the basement, which had sat completely underutilized for as long as any of the siblings could remember. Max transformed it into a space for his friend group, known as the Renegades, and kept what he discovered during the renovation to himself.
