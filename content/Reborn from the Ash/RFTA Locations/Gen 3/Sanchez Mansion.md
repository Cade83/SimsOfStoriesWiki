The **Sanchez Mansion** is a location in [[Reborn from the Ash]]. Located high in the hills above [[Windenburg]], it's the home of [[Antonio Sanchez|Antonio]] and [[Jacqueline Sanchez]].

## Profile
A towering, four story building, the Sanchez Mansion was commissioned by [[Antonio Sanchez]] upon his return to [[Windenburg]] with [[Jacqueline Sanchez|Jacqueline]], his new wife. The mansion was built according to the Sanchez's every specification. The first floor was dedicated to entertaining guests and dining. The second floor has a less formal dining area and two separate wings of the building, with one for Jacqueline, and the other for their daughter, [[Kiara Sanchez|Kiara]]. Finally, the third floor of the mansion was entirely for Antonio, featuring his office, bedroom, and a staircase to the fourth floor, which he limited access to.

The Sanchez Mansion came to be well known in Windenburg, gracing magazine covers, all aided by the lavish and exclusive parties Jacqueline regularly threw and the stories of a lucky few attendees managing to land lucrative business contracts with Antonio.
