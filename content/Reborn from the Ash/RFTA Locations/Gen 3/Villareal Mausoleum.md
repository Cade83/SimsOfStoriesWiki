The **Villareal Mausoleum** is a location in [[Reborn from the Ash]] and [[Mai Legacy]]. It's the private resting place for members of the Villareal Family, located on the [[Villareal Estate]].

## Profile
The [[Villareal Estate]] is located on a private island, including the childhood home of [[Jacques Villareal]] that was gradually built up over time and a private [[Villareal Mausoleum|mausoleum]] Jacques built for himself and his later scions.

As planned, after Jacques passed, he was entombed in his family mausoleum. His funeral was attended by all of his friends and family, and [[Akira Kibo]] and [[Luna Villareal]] spoke in his memory.

## Trivia

> The original version of Jacques's funeral.

In the earliest version of [[Mai Legacy]], when things were less established, this wasn't a mausoleum at all. It was instead a walled in open area with a few trees and a handful of wooden benches.

In the first Mai Legacy rewrite and reshoot, I found this odd. The space was small and empty, making the wall feel redundant, the funeral felt ill-suited for Jacques, and it being outdoors felt inappropriate for the season. I therefore completely overhauled this location. The wall, however, remained!
