The **Cardwell Cemetery** is a location introduced in [[Dreams of Fame]]. It's the private resting place for descendants and friends of [[Giovanna Cardwell]].

## Profile
Prior to being taken over by the Presley family, the Cardwell Cemetery was an ordinary cemetery. Two days after [[Zoe Presley]]'s death, [[Giovanna Cardwell]] managed to negotiate exclusive access to the cemetery and had all the previous individuals resting there relocated. It's unclear how exactly she managed to do so, but as with most things related to Giovanna, her family chose not to ask questions.

A private ceremony was held for Zoe Presley here, attended exclusively by the rich and famous. After her service, Giovanna painted a portrait for Zoe that was hung above her urn. When [[Jo Kauffman]] passed, she did the same for her and it was ready by the time of her memorial service.

## Resting Place for
