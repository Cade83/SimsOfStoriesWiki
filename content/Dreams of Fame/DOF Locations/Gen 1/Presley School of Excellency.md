The **Presley School of Excellency** is a location in [[Dreams of Fame]]. It was constructed by [[Zoe Presley]].

## Profile
The Presley School of Excellency was commissioned by [[Zoe Presley]]. Struck by a desire to do something good for others near the end of life, she hired [[Sergio Esparza]], who she'd previously used for expansions to her [[Presley House|home]], and the two got to work drawing up plans. 

Zoe initially planned for the school to be a family affair, with affordable tuition, her teaching English, [[Summer Holiday]] teaching cooking, and [[Giovanna Cardwell]] teaching painting, but she passed before the school was completed. While Zoe came up with the name on her own, at the school's grand opening ceremony, the official narrative became that the school was named in her honor. Despite Zoe's original vision, the Presley School of Excellency became a rather prestigious academy that specialized in the arts, becoming rather disconnected from her family.
