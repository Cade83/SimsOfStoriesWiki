**Travis Scott** is one of the protagonists of the first chapter of [[Dreams of Fame]]. He's roomed with [[Liberty Lee]] and [[Summer Holiday]] since graduating from high school.

## Profile
Travis was born to his mother [[Charlie Scott|Charlie]] and his father, who had an ill-fated marriage as they got divorced when Travis was 2, and then when he was 5, his father exited his life for good. Travis never had much of a relationship with his father as a result, but it wasn't something that ever bothered him, as [[Catherine Scott|Catherine]], the woman his mom ended up marrying, more than made up for the absence of his father. Travis respected her so much that he started bleaching and dyeing his hair in his teens so it matched hers and she felt more like part of the family.

>  Summer, Liberty, and Travis leave Zoe's.

When Travis graduated from high school, he chose to move in with [[Liberty Lee]] and [[Summer Holiday]], two of his closest friends. They purchased a [[BFFs House|home]] in [[Willow Creek]] and lifted there comfortably, as Travis's moms continued to support him financially. When [[Zoe Presley]] moved into the same neighborhood, the three of them went over to welcome her, and with time, they were all such good friends that they chose to [[Presley House|move in]] with her. While Travis was fine financially, Liberty, Summer, and Zoe could not say the same, so it was the best choice for all of them.

>  Travis discovers Zoe's hidden basement.

Upon moving in, they discovered [[Giovanna Cardwell]] locked away in Zoe's basement, but ultimately chose not to report Zoe to the police at Summer's insistence. Travis suggested reaching out to [[Jo Kauffman]], another neighbor, and let her handle things due to her having more life experience. Liberty handled this for everyone, impressing Travis, and igniting a jealous side of Summer. All three of them came to regret moving in with Zoe rather quickly, which wasn't aided by Giovanna choosing to adopt most of them. Catherine absentmindedly signed guardianship over to her, believing that it was yet another bill, and Travis became her son legally.

>  Cassandra confronts Travis, Zoe, and Summer.

As Zoe's *A Day in the Life of Granny* book series began to take off, money began to pour into the bank account the four of them shared. While Zoe continued to write, and Travis focused on his job doing cybersecurity and programming for the government, Liberty withdrawing a huge sum of money to build the [[Lee Rocket Launch]] combined with Summer's drinking habit put them in the red. Zoe demanded that Travis hack into the government and embezzle government funds to refill their bank account, and scared into compliance, he did as she demanded. The [[Mitch Laurent|President]] sent his personal secretary [[Cassandra Goth]] to resolve the issue, and she let him off with a warning as long as he returned everything due to his talent with programming.

>  Travis asks Liberty out.

When Liberty returned from space, Travis realized that he had really missed her presence. Summer, Zoe, and Giovanna were all a lot to deal with, and she was his rock. They began to spend an increasing amount of time together, something that Summer took note of, and reacted poorly to. Regardless, Travis admitted to himself that he truly liked Liberty, and finally asked her out, enraging Summer.

> Travis comforts Catherine.

When Zoe was sued by [[Zoe Patel|Patel]] for the rights to *A Day in the Life of Granny*, Travis called up his moms, as Catherine was a lawyer who could represent Zoe in court. Catherine build up her defense, then made the mistake of calling Summer as a witness, who was so pissed off at Travis that she chose to be held in contempt of court, halting court proceedings. This really got to Catherine, who was already feeling guilty for having signed over guardianship to Giovanna, but with some encouragement and reassurance from Travis, she got back on her feet. The court case was won in their favor in the end, and while it was through unconventional means, Travis and his moms took it as a victory.

>  Liberty reassures Travis.

Travis proposed to Liberty on the balcony of the second floor of the Presley house, the floor they both lived on. In between their proposal and their wedding, Summer met [[José Yépez]], and was doing a lot better, and Patel struck for a second time and withdrew a large sum of money from their bank account. Zoe once again demanded that Travis embezzle funds from the government, but this time, Liberty was there so stick up for him. Recognizing that there was no reasoning with her, Travis did as she asked, and sure enough, Cassandra turned up again. Shockingly, Giovanna knocked her out, leaving Travis with a huge mess he had to manage, and he ended up erasing his hard drive to remove evidence. With the help of [[Beatrice Stark]] and the rationality of Liberty at his side, Travis got through it all, and was able to keep his job and the money in the end.

> Charlie and Catherine walk Travis down the aisle.

Travis and Liberty were wed not long after. Their ceremony was held in a [[Wedding Park|park]] near the house that Zoe purchased as a wedding gift for the two of them so they could enjoy their privacy. Charlie and Catherine walked Travis down the aisle, and even Summer was in good spirits throughout the evening. By the end of the night, Charlie and Catherine had made their peace with Giovanna being a parental figure for Travis, and much of the bad blood in the family had been swept under the rug.

>  Travis and Liberty entertain Jacob and Clara.

Soon enough, [[Jacob Scott|Jacob]] and [[Clara Scott|Clara]] were born, and Travis and Liberty dedicated themselves to being parents. Unfortunately for them, this peaceful period of time was short-lived. Summer and José had a nasty breakup, and José, who had been there when Giovanna had knocked out Cassandra and Beatrice had dealt with her memory, felt wrong keeping that a secret for a family he no longer had a connection to. That news ended up reaching Patel, who was sure that it was spread far and wide, forcing Beatrice to return to space. She took Liberty with her, leaving Travis alone with the kids. At around this time, Summer went missing, and when José turned up to look for her, Travis was enraged and didn't want to give him the time of day. For the sake of Summer, however, he set things aside, and dedicated himself to giving everyone a role to play in the search for her.

> Travis forgives José.

Summer was discovered, and forgave and married José, however, she was soon afflicted with a strange curse. Travis once again handled giving everyone tasks and roles to play, and called Liberty down from space. This process once again brought Travis and José back together, and José apologized for what he'd done. Travis forgave him. All of Travis's planning resulted in Zoe finding an answer, and paying the ultimate price in order to cure Summer.

## Personality
Travis is the voice of reason in the Presley family. He's almost always the first person to speak up and suggest a course of action in a disagreement, and his advice is typically sound. He approaches any situation logically, and tries to determine the best person for any particular situation. That doesn't mean he's boring, however- far from it. He has a dry sense of humor that helped both [[Liberty Lee|Liberty]] and [[Summer Holiday|Summer]] fall for him. Travis can be pushed around if someone's personality is loud enough, and [[Zoe Presley|Zoe]] took advantage of that on multiple occasions.

He also has a great love for his family. Travis started dyeing his hair for [[Catherine Scott|Catherine]]'s sake so she felt as if she was part of the family, and after marrying Liberty, he began to care for Summer as family as well now that their love triangle was behind them. This attitude resulted in him being an excellent father to his children [[Jacob Scott|Jacob]] and [[Clara Scott|Clara]], and later one of two fathers to [[Nash Holiday|Nash]] whenever Summer was unreliable. The only time he ever gets angry is when his family is threatened, such as when [[José Yépez|José]] forced Liberty to return to space.
