**Charlie Scott** is a character in the first chapter of [[Dreams of Fame]]. She's the mother of [[Travis Scott]].

## Profile
Charlie realized she was a lesbian at around the time her son [[Travis Scott|Travis]] was born. She realized she had no fondness for her husband, and the two got divorced before Travis even reached the age of 2. Charlie met [[Catherine Scott|Catherine]] not long after, and the two were soon wed. Charlie's ex-husband ducked out by the time Travis was 5, leaving just Charlie and Catherine.

When Travis moved out to live with [[Liberty Lee]] and [[Summer Holiday]], Charlie and Catherine continued to pay his bills, even after he secured a job. Catherine started signing anything that came in for Travis absentmindedly, even the papers giving up guardianship of Travis to [[Giovanna Cardwell]]. When Charlie and Catherine came out to visit Travis to celebrate the success of [[Zoe Presley]]'s books, Travis gave the two of them a hard time about it at first, but he wasn't all too bothered. Charlie, on the other hand, was, and she and Catherine felt as if Giovanna stole Travis from them.

When [[Zoe Patel]] sued Zoe Presley for the rights to *A Day in the Life of Granny*, Travis asked Catherine to represent Zoe in [[Willow Creek Courthouse|court]]. Charlie came out with her for moral support, even though she knew the majority of the trip would be sitting quietly in a courthouse while people debated a case she wasn't personally invested in. The real reason she was there was to spend time with her wife and son.

Charlie and Catherine were thrilled when they received the invitations for Travis's wedding to Liberty. They were eager to be involved in the set up for the ceremony, and both wanted to be there to help Travis dress up for the event and to walk him down the aisle. The ceremony brought both of them to tears. At the end of the night, they both went to apologize to Giovanna for ever doubting her. Charlie knew that she'd never replace her and Catherine, but she sure made her son and daughter-in-law happy.

## Personality
An incredibly lighthearted individual, Charlie can always be heard cracking jokes and making light of her unfortunate marriage to [[Travis Scott|Travis]]'s father. She's good at keeping things fun for everyone, and her friendly way of speaking makes her incredibly approachable.

Charlie cares deeply for her small family. She and [[Catherine Scott|Catherine]] are nearly joined at the hip, as Charlie refuses to be parted from her. Continuing to pay for Travis's living expenses even after he moved out was a way for Charlie to feel attached to him, so [[Giovanna Cardwell|Giovanna]] legally adopting her wounded her deeply. By Travis's wedding, however, Charlie recognized just how much Travis cared for her and vice-versa, and she began to feel like family too, in her own unique way.
