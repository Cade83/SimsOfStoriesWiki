## Profile

> Terra talks to Summer on the phone.

Terra always had a contentious relationship with her daughter, [[Summer Holiday|Summer]], with Summer seeing her as an overly critical witch, and Terra seeing her as an entitled brat. Regardless, she gave her what advice she could. Terra, recognizing that her daughter was obsessed with the man, regularly told Summer she could do much better than [[Travis Scott]]. When [[Giovanna Cardwell]] wished to adopt Summer, she staged a huge fight with Terra that got her disowned, all so Giovanna would adopt her and she would end up closer to Travis. When Terra heard about this later from Summer, she refused to hear it, and hung up on her.

> Summer confronts Terra.

When Summer got married to [[José Yépez]], Terra showed up to the wedding uninvited, wanting to finally get to know her daughter now that her husband had passed. Willing to admit to her faults if Summer would admit to her own, Terra offered Summer a fresh start. Summer refused to even entertain the idea, telling Terra that she'd greatly exaggerated her importance in her life.

## Personality
Terra is an overly critical woman who suffers from a lack of patience. She struggled to sit through [[Summer Holiday|Summer]]'s boy troubles in high school, and when they continued on past then, she threw in the towel. Summer moving in with [[Travis Scott|Travis]] after high school was a breaking point, and the two stopped talking. She instead chose to treat herself to the finer things in life, such as exotic vacations that she never invited Summer to.

She ended up regretting her behavior later in life, after her husband passed and she was left with no family. But was too prideful to ever make a second attempt at connecting with Summer.
