> [!quote|author] Beatrice to Liberty.
> “Back when I first traveled to your planet, I regularly found myself stressed out. I was in an unfamiliar environment, and I missed home. But, I quickly found that if I spent a bit of time looking up at the stars… there were always a few familiar ones I could pick out. Then, I wasn’t so lonely anymore.”

**Beatrice Stark**, known in Sixamese as **Xayri**, is a character in the first chapter of [[Dreams of Fame]]. She's an alien on the run from the royal family of [[Sixam]].

## Profile

> Xayri serves on Sixam's Royal Court.

Xayri saw a great deal of success in both her personal life and career during her time living on [[Sixam]]. She worked hard, and eventually became a Royal Judge of Sixam, serving under Queen [[Xanthippe]]. During this time, she passed righteous judgement on the people of Sixam and visiting humans alike. Due to her diplomatic way of carrying herself and unbiased way of determining right and wrong, she was recognized by Xanthippe, and later the crown prince, [[Xanther]] and she began spending time with them.

>  Xayri with Mitch.

Xanther wished to strengthen Sixam's relations with humanity, and he formed the Human Relations Committee to do so. With Xanthippe's permission, he appointed Xayri as their ambassador. Xayri served the royal family in this role for 400 years without issue, and met with each [[President]]. It was when Xayri met [[Mitch Laurent]] that things changed for her. She began to develop feelings for the man, something that was strictly forbidden under the orders of Quinn Xanthippe. Xayri and Mitch were put on trial before the Queen's throne. Xayri begged for leniency for Mitch, and he was able to get away with only removed memories, but Xayri was sentenced to death.

> Beatrice runs into Liberty.

Xanther chose to defy his sister's orders, and he snuck into Xayri's cell, freed her, and told her to flee. Xayri was in luck, as while she fled, she ran into [[Liberty Lee]], who had stumbled across Sixam and was gathering alien flora and fauna. Adopting the name Beatrice, she begged Liberty to allow her on her ship. Liberty agreed, and once they landed, she assumed a new life under the name of Beatrice Stark, the name of a human ambassador to the Sixamese that she'd befriended decades earlier. As Beatrice, she rented out a crappy [[Beatrice's Condo|condo]], then dedicated herself to helping the Presleys.

>  Beatrice adjusts Cassandra's memories.

During [[Zoe Patel]]'s case against [[Zoe Presley]] over the rights of *A Day in the Life of Granny*, Liberty reached out to Beatrice, and Beatrice first tried to mess with the [[Judge]]'s cognition, then tried to pose as [[Jo Kauffman]]. She later erased [[Cassandra Goth]]'s memories of [[Travis Scott]] embezzling funds from the government, all of which was witnessed by [[José Yépez]], who was rather bothered by what she'd done and how little everyone else seemed to care. He later chose to report this to the government, which forced Beatrice to flee and return to Sixam, as she would chose imprisonment and death over human experimentation. She forced Liberty to serve as her pilot and companion, insisting that she owed her for all she'd done for her family.

> Beatrice and Liberty on Sixam.

Once back on Sixam, Beatrice and Liberty took up residence in the [[Sixam Research Center]], a long since abandoned building built by humans. While they spent time there, Beatrice finally opened up to Liberty about her past as Xayri, and the customs of her people, all of which fascinated Liberty. She even ended up making return trips alongside Beatrice, eager to learn more. Those days eventually came to an end, however, as the Sixamese discovered her presence, and Xanther was sent to personally capture her under the orders of Queen Xanthippe. 

## Personality
Beatrice values justice, order, and righteousness, and spent the majority of her life living up to those values. She was entirely dedicated to her career, as she felt it was what would bring the greatest amount of good into the world. Things began to shift for her after she met [[Mitch Laurent|Mitch]], however. She recognized that her priorities shifted to be more self-interested, and she was willing to do things for him even if it came at a personal cost to herself. This later occurred again with [[Liberty Lee|Liberty]] and her family, as she valued their safety and happiness, even if obtaining those things required means that her earlier self would have disapproved of. Regardless, she never stopped valuing fairness, and much of her relationship with Liberty became a series of repaying debts and favors.

Despite her long years as an ambassador to humanity, Beatrice never get understood how to blend in, and many found her somewhat off-putting, all of which wasn't aided by her tendency to be very direct. Being forced to live away from [[Sixam]] began to help her blend in, and her fashion sense shifted from something others would give strange looks to clothing that could pass as an average outfit. She still holds her home and the royal family close to her heart, however, and nothing can ever stop her from continuing to pine for her home planet.
