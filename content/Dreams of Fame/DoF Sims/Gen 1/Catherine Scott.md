**Catherine Scott** is a character in the first chapter of [[Dreams of Fame]]. She's a lawyer and the stepmother of [[Travis Scott]].

## Profile
Catherine was already a lawyer who had led several clients to decisive victories at the time she met [[Charlie Scott|Charlie]], and many assumed she'd end up falling for someone who could command a room in the same way she did. Catherine, however, fell for Charlie's bubbly and gregarious personality, and the two were married within a year. She became the stepmother to Charlie's son from her previous marriage, [[Travis Scott|Travis]], who was still an infant at the time she married Charlie. Charlie's ex-husband vanished from the picture by the time Travis was 5, and Catherine became just as important of a parent to him as Charlie. In his teens, Travis began dyeing his hair to match Catherine's to make her feel like just as much as his mom as Charlie.

When Travis moved out to live with [[Liberty Lee]] and [[Summer Holiday]], Catherine and Charlie continued to pay his bills at Charlie's insistence, even after he secured a job. Catherine started signing anything that came in for Travis absentmindedly, even the papers giving up guardianship of Travis to [[Giovanna Cardwell]]. When Catherine and Charlie came out to visit Travis to celebrate the success of [[Zoe Presley]]'s books, Travis gave the two of them a hard time about it at first, but he wasn't all too bothered. Charlie was, and Catherine was bothered too, but she felt more guilty than anything else. In her opinion, Travis was grown.

When [[Zoe Patel]] sued Zoe Presley for the rights to *A Day in the Life of Granny*, Travis asked Catherine to represent Zoe in [[Willow Creek Courthouse|court]]. She struggled to find an angle for Zoe, as she'd self-published each of her books under the pen name of Zoe P, and there was little connecting her directly to their publication. She also feared bringing up Giovanna because of Zoe's criminal treatment of her in the past. Instead, Catherine ended up bringing out Zoe's roommates on the stand, all of whom were terrible. The case was saved when Giovanna herself walked into the courtroom, and the [[Judge|judge]], who happened to be a huge fan, recognized her instantly.

Catherine and Charlie were thrilled when they received the invitations for Travis's wedding to Liberty. They wanted to be involved in the set up for the ceremony, and to help Travis dress up for the event and ultimately walk him down the aisle. Catherine offered to walk Liberty down the aisle, as her parents didn't show, but Giovanna took the job instead. The ceremony brought both of them to tears. At the end of the night, they both went to apologize to Giovanna for ever doubting her. 

## Personality
In comparison to [[Charlie Scott|Charlie]], Catherine is significantly more grounded, and knows how to ask pointed questions that get the ball rolling, likely aided by her experience as a lawyer. That doesn't mean Catherine doesn't know how to have fun, however.

As a stepmother, a part of Catherine always felt like a secondary mother to [[Travis Scott|Travis]]. She almost felt like she was competing with her at times, and once [[Giovanna Cardwell|Giovanna]] entered the picture, she was competing with two mothers. Travis originally started dyeing his hair blond to match hers to alleviate this, years ago, but her doubts persisted, even cropping up during Case: Zoe v. Zoe. Charlie and Travis recognized this part of her, however, and always did their best to reassure her that she and Charlie were equals.
