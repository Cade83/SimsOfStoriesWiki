> “I think I’m here to help people. Those neighbors you dislike so much have even come to rely on me, in certain cases. But whether it’s those neighbors, or you and your family, Amelia, there is nothing I enjoy more than helping out a friend.”

**Jo Kauffman** is a character in both [[Dreams of Fame]] and [[Courage & Resolve]]. She lives on the same street as the Presley and Brown families, and considers herself a friend of [[Amelia Brown]] and [[Giovanna Cardwell]]. 

## Profile

> Jo moves into the neighborhood.

Not much is known about Jo's life prior to her move to [[Willow Creek]]. She stopped dating after college after having two disappointing relationships with men, but the rest of her past is something she refused to discuss, having told [[Zoe Presley]] that delving into any of it would only bring up painful memories.

> Jo makes a police report.

As a neighbor, Jo was furiously defensive of [[Giovanna Cardwell]]. The two of them first met when she wandered away from Zoe and ended up at [[Jo's House]]. When Giovanna was kidnapped and kept in Zoe's basement, she personally launched a search for her. She later learned from [[Liberty Lee]] that Zoe had kept Giovanna locked away in her basement, which Jo reported to the [[Geoffrey Landgraab|police]]. Unfortunately for Jo, Giovanna didn't exist in any official records, and she was laughed out of the police station. This is where her dislike of Zoe Presley, and eventually the rest of the family in that household began, but she continued to spend time with them for the sake of Giovanna and the family members she could tolerate.

> Jo meets Amelia for [[Willow Creek Cafe|coffee]].

Sometime after Jo found out the truth about Giovanna, she was welcomed to the neighborhood by [[Amelia Brown]], and the two became fast friends. Amelia would talk to her about her problems, and Jo enjoyed listening to her and providing advice, even at one point telling her that she believed her primary purpose in this world was to help people. Throughout this time period, Jo spent most of her time entertaining either Giovanna or Amelia over afternoon tea. When she was over at the [[Presley House]], most of her time was spent being completely blown away by all the unbelievable things that happened to that family, which she would then spill to Amelia. Regardless, they continued to ask her over hoping she could provide them with sound advice, and she always did the best she could.

> Jo confronts Samson.

The end of Jo's life came about through a chain of events that she was largely unrelated to. When [[Samson Brown]], Amelia's ex-husband, came to Willow Creek, Jo was a regular source of comfort and advice for Amelia, and this was something Samson picked up on. When he realized that both of his children had zero interest in treating him as a father, he forced his lawyer, [[Stefan Barrens]], to come up with a plan B. The two of them chose to interrogate Jo for information about Amelia in a hidden basement in her home, but while interrogating her, Samson snapped, and knocked her to the ground, killing her. Stefan helped Samson cover up the murder.

######  Post Murder

> Amelia questions the Presleys about Jo's death.

In the days following Jo's death, only Amelia was convinced that her passing hadn't been an accident. She got her friends at [[Beauchamp Law]] to believe her, but the police ruled her death accidental, and [[Travis Scott]] was tasked with questioning the [[Adrienne Brooks|realtor]]  who sold her the house, so they were unable to do anything to assist her. When Amelia asked the Presley Family for their opinions at Jo's funeral, they found her questions disrespectful and off-putting.

## Personality
An incredibly level-headed woman, Jo has a clear distinction of what's right and wrong, and is always willing to stick up for what she believes in. She wrote off love a long time ago, and while she occasionally finds herself wondering what her life might've been like if she'd made different choices, she never dwells on it for long. Jo is loyal to both her friends and her own moral code, and has a great love for socialization. 

Her love for socialization comes in a few different forms. One of Jo's greatest joys is entertaining friends over afternoon tea in the comfort of her own home, where she gives advice and opinions. She also tends to be a bit of a gossip, and those conversations tend to be when she is at her least serious.
