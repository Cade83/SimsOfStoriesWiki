> [!quote|author] Summer to Travis and Liberty
> “Look at what you're doing to me! [...] Zoe’s already spent the money we earned from selling the house the three of us bought *as friends* on her stupid book tour! Doesn’t help that you two are always freaking eyeing each other, she’s running around like a chicken with it’s head cut off, and I’m literally the only sane person left in this dumb purple house!”

**Summer Holiday** is one of the protagonists of the first chapter of [[Dreams of Fame]]. She's roomed with [[Travis Scott]] and [[Liberty Lee]] since graduating from high school.

## Profile
Summer Holiday had a difficult relationship with her parents growing up, especially with her mother, [[Terra Holiday|Terra]]. Summer felt as if she was overly critical of her every last decision, and Terra saw her as entitled. This only worsened throughout high school, as Summer began to pursue [[Travis Scott]] romantically, and Terra continually told Summer that she could do better. She was horrified when, after graduating high school, Summer chose to [[BFFs House|move in]] with Travis and a mutual friend by the name of [[Liberty Lee]].

When [[Zoe Presley]] moved into the neighborhood, the three of them became good friends with her, and eventually, they all chose to move in together. Summer was personally against moving into [[Presley House|Zoe's house]], describing it as a "plum hell", but she was overruled. Upon moving in, they discovered [[Giovanna Cardwell]] locked away in Zoe's basement, but at Summer's insistence, they chose not to contact the police themselves.

Summer, Travis, and Liberty quickly came to regret moving in with Zoe, but Summer in particular was more bothered than others. She found Zoe to be a controlling nightmare, Giovanna frustrating, she hated the decor, and worst of all, Travis was clearly beginning to fall for Liberty instead of her. She began to fluctuate between meltdowns and drinking to numb everything she was feeling, and quickly reached a point where bottles of wine would be half gone by noon.

>  Summer tells Zoe about the spiritual guidance session.

Regardless of her growing dependency on alcohol, Summer began to some plans into action to make her life into something more bearable. When Giovanna wanted to adopt Zoe, Travis, and Liberty, Summer was initially glad Giovanna wasn't interested in her, as she had no fondness for the woman. When Liberty's parents declined, however, Summer realized that being legally bound to Travis could bring the two of them closer together. She called her mom, staged a huge fight, and once she was disowned, she got Giovanna to submit the paperwork. She also reached out to [[Melody Roach]], and demanded that she perform hypnotherapy on Zoe to make her into a more bearable roommate, which Melody agreed to once she saw the massive sum of money she was offering. This was one of many factors that drove the family to bankruptcy, but Zoe didn't suspect anything as she had buried the funds alongside her wine expenses, and presented her paperwork to the session as 'free spiritual guidance.'

Summer's plans worked, as Zoe came back from [[Melody's Therapy|Melody's]] a changed woman, and with Liberty in space, she got to spend more time alone with Travis than ever. Her days of basking in her success were rather short-lived, unfortunately for Summer, as Liberty eventually returned, and while out celebrating Zoe's recent success at the [[Club Lounge]], Summer caught sight of Travis and Liberty holding hands. She went off alone to go drown her sorrows, and was approached by [[José Yépez]], who recognized that she was going through something. He gave her his info, just in case she ever needed someone to talk to. In the days that followed, the house devolved into its usual chaos, and Summer felt isolated from everyone she lived with, but to make matters worse, she overheard Travis asking out Liberty. Summer went off to drink alone, and when she tried to call her mom, she refused to hear her out.

>  Summer tends the bar at Travis and Liberty's wedding.

Absolutely miserable with every aspect of her life, and disliking herself quite a bit, Summer drank more than ever, and one night, she got drunk and lonely enough to actually text José. He was incredibly receptive to her problems, and Summer, actually feeling heard for the first time ever, began to spend time with him. While they had some rough patches at first, especially with Summer lashing out at him as she tended to lash out at others, José took it all in stride, and they ended up dating within that first year of knowing each other. Summer even managed to get through Travis's wedding to Liberty without any issues, and even managed to use that night for her own personal development, realizing that she could turn her ability to cook and make drinks into a career.

>  Summer dances to José's guitar.

The days where Summer was dating José were the happiest she'd been up to that point in her life. They'd hit up fancy bars, and drink and chat, and then they'd go to [[José's House]], where he would strum his guitar or put a record on while Summer would dance. It all came to a very abrupt end when Summer admitted to José that their relationship had only begun because she'd needed a rebound from Travis. Hurt and betrayed, José approached the government with a family secret he'd been keeping that had been weighing on him.

>  Summer passes out in Sylvan Glade.

At the [[President’s Mansion]], he ran into [[Zoe Patel]], an enemy of Summer's family. Recognizing his connection to the family, and that he was in a bad place with Summer, she began to pursue him romantically, all of which she was sure to personally tell Summer. In response, Summer drank more than she had in a long time, then wandered off and passed out in [[Sylvan Glade]], resulting in her family and José mobilizing to search for her.

>  Summer and José enjoy their wedding.

Once she was found, Summer was rushed to the [[Willow Creek Hospital|hospital]], and José showed up to apologize profusely. He then proposed right then, and Summer happily said yes. The two of them were wed at the [[Blue Velvet]], a favorite bar of Summer's, and the place she'd worked years ago. With José forgiven by her family, her wedding was well attended. To Summer's surprise, even her mother showed up. Terra was looking to make amends and start over, but only if Summer was also willing to admit her faults. Summer refused, telling her that it was far too late. That evening, for the first time in a long time, Summer realized that she was truly happy.

>  Summer holds Zoe after her sacrifice.

A few months after Summer got pregnant with [[Nash Holiday|Nash]], she was struck by the Sylvan Curse, and began to age rapidly. Her family scrambled as they tried to figure out what was happening to her, and surprisingly, the one who managed to save her was Zoe. After consulting with the [[Mortimer Goth|Goth]] [[Bella Goth|Family]], Zoe realized what she had to do, and went to Sylvan Glade to trade her life for Summer's. As Summer realized what Zoe had done for her, she was filled with a deep guilt, knowing what she'd done to Zoe years ago, and how, despite it all, Zoe had been willing to give everything up for her.

## Personality
When Summer sets her mind to something, she pursues it relentlessly. This happens first with her desire for [[Travis Scott|Travis]] setting the entire initial trajectory of her life, and later her need to enjoy her living situation resulting in irreversible damage to [[Zoe Presley|Zoe]]'s psyche. When the thing she's pursuing is yanked away from her, however, Summer has a tendency to spiral, beginning to lash out at others around her and drink obsessively, or, if she truly feels defeated as she did with [[José Yépez|José]], she simply gives up and allows herself to be consumed by soul-crushing despair.

Summer has a tendency to be exceedingly cruel with her words, and furiously defensive of her choices, even if she herself recognizes that she's screwed up. Living in the [[Presley House]] only amplified her worst tendencies, especially during times when she was unhappy, but Summer recognizes that she's been a bitch for the vast majority of her life. That doesn't mean she's immune to feelings of guilt, or regret, for both her actions, and what happens to others. Summer would just chose not to admit those feelings. The only person she's able to truly open up to is José.
