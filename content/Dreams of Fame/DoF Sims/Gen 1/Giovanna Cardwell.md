**Giovanna Cardwell**, also known as **Granny**, is a primary character in the [[Dreams of Fame]] story. She's the namesake for the titular character in the hit *A Day in the Life of Granny* book series.

## Profile

> Giovanna paints in Windenburg, as told in one of her stories.

Much of Giovanna's past is shrouded in mystery. It's clear that she used to galavant across the world with her [[Granny's Husband|husband]], a man who may or may not have existed, painting whatever caught her eye and enjoying her free spirited lifestyle. Giovanna claims that she married her husband on the day a meteor struck the shirt factory in [[San Myshuno]]'s Fashion District, that she'd explored ancient temples in [[Selvadorada]], that she was once a model, or that she lived in a cottage in [[Windenburg]] with her husband until she burned it down, at which point she flew to [[Willow Creek]] and dealt with a war of storybook characters. Regardless, it remains clear that the [[Magnolia Blossom]] park remained a special place for her, as she returned on multiple occasions.

> Giovanna's version of events at her husband's funeral.

It's in that park where she met [[Zoe Presley]]. Zoe, who was a struggling author, recognized that Giovanna had an endless series of stories to tell after one interaction with her and chose to befriend Giovanna for the sake of her writing career. She left a note under a rock with her address for Giovanna to find, which Giovanna missed. Giovanna insists that this was the week her husband died and that she was busy as a result. She says that she buried him in a [[Giovanna's Husband's Grave|secret location]],and had a private ceremony that was interrupted by [[Zoe Patel]]. Giovanna claims that she fought Patel off, but Patel's version of events are very different.

> Zoe tells Giovanna her vision for publishing her stories.

After enough time had passed for Zoe to have given up on Giovanna, she finally showed up at Zoe's front door. Zoe told Giovanna that she wanted to publish her stories, at which point Giovanna offered to illustrate, launching their business partnership and the future hit book series *A Day in the Life of Granny*, credited to a "Zoe P". During the early days of their business partnership, Zoe gave Giovanna a makeover and she met and befriended Zoe's neighbors [[Liberty Lee]], [[Travis Scott]], [[Summer Holiday]], and [[Jo Kauffman]], becoming especially close with Jo in particular.

> Giovanna gradually loses her mind in the basement.

Things were going so well that Zoe eventually asked Giovanna to move in with her. Giovanna adamantly refused- she didn't want to be tied down to any one place. Unknown to Giovanna was that Zoe had stolen a bag of Giovanna's money and used it to add a basement to [[Presley House|her house]], fully intending on keeping Giovanna in her life at ant cost. Zoe rearranged furniture to ensure she could block the entrance to her new basement, then hunted down Giovanna and trapped her in the basement with an easel and a kitchen with a fridge that she'd fully stocked. Looking down on her, Zoe dubbed her 'Granny', as she looked like her grandmother, who Zoe said had always let her down. Giovanna stayed locked in that basement for months on end, and at a certain point, her mind started to go, and she began to hear her stories in her mind. She began to lose herself in her paintings, they were how she escaped- nothing could go wrong in her painted world.

> Travis, Summer, and Liberty discover Giovanna.

Noticing Giovanna's absence and finding the fact that Zoe was able to continue churning out fully illustrated books without her to be incredibly suspicious, Jo questioned Zoe, but Zoe was evasive. Giovanna wasn't found until Liberty, Travis, and Summer all chose to move in with Zoe and decided to investigate the odd corner of the house that Zoe always had blocked off. Left with no other choice, Zoe was forced to release Giovanna and her new roommates all chose not to report her to the police. While Giovanna was free, a part of her seemingly died in that basement, and her mind and her wanderlust never came back.

> Giovanna shares the news about her adoptions.

With time, and with the moniker of 'Granny', Giovanna came to see herself as a parental figure to Zoe, Travis, and Liberty. Summer was excluded, as Giovanna wasn't particular fond of her. She ended up filing adoption papers for all three of them. [[Ibrahaim Presley]] signed over guardianship for Zoe, [[Catherine Scott]] for Travis, and when Liberty's parents refused, Giovanna settled for Summer, who had already been disowned by [[Terra Holiday]]. Meanwhile, with Giovanna once again telling Zoe increasingly outlandish stories now that she was free of the basement, *A Day in the Life of Granny* took off, money began to pour in, and Giovanna became rather famous, despite her complete lack of public appearances.

> Giovanna singlehandedly ends the case and signs her first autograph.

The extreme wealth and fame of Giovanna's family also began to attract the attention of those who wanted it for themselves. Zoe Patel recognized Giovanna from the time where she and her husband broke into her house years ago, aided by the fact that she'd chased them to her husband's grave years after. She also picked up on the fact that *A Day in the Life of Granny* was only credited to a "Zoe P". Patel claimed that she was the actual author of the hit series, and that Zoe Presley was merely an imposter, leveraging the fact that Zoe continued to insist that Giovanna was a fictional character, while she herself had photographic evidence of her on security footage. This resulted in a lengthy legal battle, which dragged as Giovanna was too unreliable of a witness to testify and too challenging for Liberty's alien friend [[Beatrice Stark]] to imitate. Things only ended when Giovanna wandered her way into court, uttered her iconic phrase, and interacted exclusively with Zoe's side of the court. The [[Judge]] ruled in Zoe's favor without hesitation and asked for an autograph.

> Giovanna tells Jacob and Clara a story.

As she aged, whenever Giovanna wasn't storytelling or painting, she was spending time sipping tea with Jo at her [[Jo's House|house]], or swapping wild stories with Beatrice. Zoe also came to recognize a lot of the wrongdoing she'd done earlier on, and apologized to Giovanna for screwing up her mind. Whether for better or worse, Giovanna was unbothered, and forgave her. She became a true grandmother when Liberty and Travis had [[Jacob Scott|Jacob]] and [[Clara Scott|Clara]], and one of her favorite pastimes became telling them her wildest stories and watching their shocked expressions. When Zoe passed on somewhat unexpectedly, Giovanna was noticeably quieter- it was clearly something that affected her deeper than she let on.

## Personality
Giovanna is very much a free spirit. She wants to dedicate her life to do anything that catches her interest, and she lived this way both before and after [[Zoe Presley|Zoe]] locked her in her basement and her mind. At first, it was roaming the world, experiencing everything she could, and capturing it on her canvas, but even after the basement, her spirit endured. She chose to adopt Zoe, [[Travis Scott|Travis]], and [[Summer Holiday|Summer]] on a whim, her appearance at court was entirely by her design, there is nothing in the world that can keep her locked down forever.

Giovanna also loves very deeply. She dedicated her early life to her [[Granny's Husband|husband]], and once the Presley family became her family, and she took on the mantle of 'Granny', she began to care for them as if they were her children. This mindset endured- if it's her family, she's willing to do anything she can to assist. Giovanna was even able to forgive Zoe, despite the atrocities she committed against her, and was saddened when she passed, as Giovanna saw the good that had been buried within her for years finally surface.

Unfortunately, Giovanna's mind and thought process weren't great before she was imprisoned on the basement, and they fell off dramatically while she was down there. She communicates through her paintings and her stories, and has even been known to gift paintings to people to express what she can't with words. She's also a woman who wears her heart on her sleeve, and if she's happy, it'll show.
