**Liberty Lee** is one of the protagonists of the first chapter of [[Dreams of Fame]]. She's roomed with [[Travis Scott]] and [[Summer Holiday]] since graduating from high school.

## Profile
Liberty grew up with two loving parents who allowed her to pursue any interest she wanted. In school, she cycled through clubs and hobbies as she pleased, trying whatever happened to interest her at the time. During this time, she befriended [[Travis Scott]] and a mutual friend of his, [[Summer Holiday]]. Liberty had consistent issues with Summer due to her frequently less than pleasant attitude, but she enjoyed Travis's company enough to agree to move in with both him and Summer right after graduation. They all purchased a [[BFFs House|home]] on a residential street in [[Willow Creek]]. While Travis and Summer got jobs right away, Liberty wasn't nearly as concerned. She knew that she'd find something whenever inspiration struck.

 It was at this time in Liberty's life that [[Zoe Presley]], a budding author, moved in across the street. She, Travis, and Summer all really clicked with her, and they all chose to move in with Zoe to save everyone some money. Shortly after moving in, they discovered Zoe's basement, where she'd imprisoned [[Giovanna Cardwell]]. At Summer's insistence, Liberty and Travis begrudgingly agreed not to turn Zoe into the police as long as Giovanna was freed. Unknown to Summer, however, Liberty visited [[Jo Kauffman]], another neighbor of theirs who knew Giovanna, and had her report the story to the police. Not much amounted from it, however.

Liberty grew increasingly frustrated living at [[Presley House|Zoe's house]]. Giovanna wasn't in her right mind, Zoe was controlling and quite frankly scary, and Summer had started to antagonize Liberty because she believed she was making moves on Travis. Desperate for an escape, Liberty signed up to be an astronaut, which was something she'd always had an interest in. Using money from Zoe's recent success with her *A Day in the Life of Granny* book sales, she built a [[Lee Rocket Launch|rocket launch pad]], constructed a rocket, and happily departed her reality, headed of to explore space instead.

It took a bit, but eventually, Liberty's rocket touched down on the planet of [[Sixam]]. As she collected various samples, she was startled by [[Beatrice Stark]], an alien who desperately needed to flee Sixam. While she was frustrated to cut her trip short, Liberty let Beatrice onto her rocket and returned home. As she introduced Beatrice to her ridiculous family, Liberty realized that she missed them all, especially Travis, who had welcomed her home with a warm hug.

Liberty came to realize that Travis and Summer had almost nothing in common, that Summer had no actual ambition, and most importantly, that she'd missed Travis while she was in space and felt as if he'd missed her too. Liberty and Travis began to spend a lot more time together, even dancing together, all of which brought on Summer's wrath, but they persisted. Eventually, Travis finally asked Liberty out and she gleefully accepted.

>  Beatrice demonstrates her powers to Liberty.

When [[Zoe Patel|Patel]] sued Zoe for the rights to *A Day in the Life of Granny*, Liberty was called on as a witness and wasn't much of a help. Feeling guilty, she reached out to Jo, who refused to assist Zoe in any scenario, so she then turned to Beatrice. Liberty and Beatrice hatched a scheme where Beatrice disguised herself as Jo then scrambled the [[Judge]]'s mind to ensure that Zoe won her court case. Beatrice failed, but with the appearance of Giovanna, the ruling was in Zoe's favor. She reached out to Beatrice again when Zoe forced Travis to embezzle funds and [[Cassandra Goth]] showed up to handle the situation, asking her to adjust Cassandra's memories of the incident. This was all observed by Summer's new boyfriend, [[José Yépez]].

Travis proposed to Liberty on the second floor of the Presley House, where the two of them spent most of their time together. From there, they began planning their wedding. It was held in a [[Wedding Park|park]] not far from the house that Zoe purchased as a wedding gift, and attended by everyone they knew in Willow Creek, plus Travis's moms [[Charlie Scott|Charlie]] and [[Catherine Scott|Catherine]]. Liberty's parents were on a cruise at the time and refused to end it early, so Giovanna walked Liberty down the aisle instead. Their wedding went off perfectly, with Liberty telling Travis that she'd never been happier.

> Liberty entertains Jacob.

Two years later, [[Jacob Scott|Jacob]] and [[Clara Scott|Clara]] were born. Liberty and Travis raised them with love and care, but that time was cut short when José felt the need to report Beatrice to the government for what she'd done to Cassandra. All of this public attention meant that Beatrice had to flee the planet. She asked Liberty to accompany her, and despite Travis's insistence that the kids needed her, Liberty felt a need to repay Beatrice. They departed for Sixam that very night.

Up on Sixam, Liberty and Beatrice took shelter in an [[Sixam Research Center|abandoned research center]]. She immediately began to miss her kids and Travis, so Beatrice tried her best to distract her with tales of her time serving as an ambassador to humanity. By the time Liberty was finally able to return, she'd missed both of her kids' birthdays. She felt horrible about it, but she still wanted to assist Beatrice and keep learning about her people. With Travis's reassurance, she kept going to space.

> Liberty engages in discussion about Summer's illness.

When Summer came down with a mysterious illness, Travis contacted Liberty and got her to return from space. She did her best to assist, but in the end, it was Zoe who found the cure and ended up paying the ultimate price. After Zoe's passing, Liberty declared to herself that she'd spend more time with Travis and her children, but her mind kept drifting back to Beatrice and Sixam.

## Personality
Liberty is the quietest out of the trio of her, [[Travis Scott|Travis]], and [[Summer Holiday|Summer]]. She often felt drowned out by Summer and before she and Travis connected, Liberty felt like the least valuable voice in the room. Liberty still asserted her opinion quietly, however, such as when she reported [[Zoe Presley|Zoe]] to [[Jo Kauffman|Jo]]. After her first trip to [[Sixam]], however, Liberty realized just how valued she was and she began to assert her opinion more often. She developed a deep love for Travis, as she felt as if he was the one who saw all of her, encouraged her to open up, and loved her for it.

Liberty has always been very driven by her own interests. She was unemployed for a while out of college, as nothing spoke to her, but once she got into exploring space, it became her entire life. This became a problem later on, as she chose to spend more time with [[Beatrice Stark|Beatrice]] on Sixam than with [[Jacob Scott|Jacob]] and [[Clara Scott|Clara]], a fact that came to haunt her. Liberty's need to repay Beatrice kept her in space, but her guilt over not being a mother to her children made Liberty want to remain on earth. Interested in both, she is completely torn.
