**Zoe Presley** is the protagonist of the first chapter of [[Dreams of Fame]].

## Profile

> Zoe moves into her home.

Zoe Presley always knew that she was meant to be an author. She refused to pursue any other career, even during the periods in her life where ideas didn't come to her and the books she did manage to publish, most of which were romance novels, didn't sell. Zoe moved out to [[Willow Creek]] in her mid-twenties, once her father, [[Ibrahaim Presley]], forced her to move out of his home and get [[Presley House|her own place]].

> Giovanna tells Zoe one of her stories.

Zoe's life and career were forever altered when she went to [[Magnolia Blossom]] Park one afternoon, looking for inspiration, and ran into [[Giovanna Cardwell]]. As Giovanna started to tell Zoe about her life, Zoe realized that what her books had been missing was a shock factor. Determined to build up a working relationship with Giovanna where she would tell Zoe stories, and she would write and sell them, Zoe invited Giovanna over to her home. As time passed, Giovanna began illustrating Zoe's books, and Zoe built up a friendship with her neighbors [[Liberty Lee]], [[Travis Scott]], and [[Summer Holiday]]. With *A Day in the Life of Granny* hitting shelves under the simplistic pen name of Zoe P, her life was on the up.

> Zoe locks Giovanna in her basement.

Things changed for Zoe when she asked Giovanna to move in with her. Giovanna refused, not wanting to give up her free-spirited lifestyle, making Zoe realize that her arrangement with Giovanna was something that might be entirely temporary. Zoe went to an extreme, and used Giovanna's money to add a basement to her house to trap Giovanna in. Giovanna stayed in that basement for months, forced to paint to illustrate Zoe's novels, which continued to bring in an ever increasing amount of money for her. Her neighbor, [[Jo Kauffman]], put up missing person posters, but Zoe continued to deny any knowledge of Giovanna's whereabouts. She was only exposed when Liberty, Travis, and Summer moved in with her, and discovered Giovanna in the basement. They chose not to report her to the police, but Liberty told Jo where Giovanna had been, and she did. Giovanna, however, did not exist in any official records, and Zoe got away with her crimes.

> Zoe enjoys her success.

Due to the success of *A Day in the Life of Granny*, Zoe began to enjoy a small degree of celebrity status. At her book talks, she claimed that everything in the book came from her own mind, and gave Giovanna zero credit. She began to enjoy her success so much that she demanded more, and the output at which Giovanna illustrated for her was no longer cutting it. Her roommates benefited as well, with Liberty building a [[Lee Rocket Launch|rocket launching pad]], and Summer partaking in increasingly expensive wines. All of this drove the family to bankruptcy. Knowing that Travis was a programmer who worked for the [[Mitch Laurent|government]], Zoe demanded that he embezzle funds so she could continue to live her expensive lifestyle. He did so out of a genuine fear of Zoe, resulting in government officials showing up at the house and demanding the return of the money. Zoe redevoted herself to her writing after the fact, and the family made their fortune back.

> Zoe insists that they'll see even greater success.

During the hacking the government fiasco, Summer gave Zoe a voucher for a free therapy session, which Zoe gladly took, believing it was Summer recognizing how stressed she was as a celebrity. What Zoe didn't realize, however, was that it was a hypnotherapy session performed by [[Melody Roach]], intended to make her more mellow. Summer had grown sick of Zoe's uptight, domineering attitude, and wanted to see her changed. Melody's work was so effective, that Zoe ended up more like Giovanna that her original self. It didn't entirely erase her original personality, however, as when [[Zoe Patel]] took to the news with evidence that Giovanna was a real person, insisting that she was the real author, Zoe snapped right back to her original self.

> Zoe fights Patel in court.

Patel's claims launched a lengthy legal battle between herself and the Presley Family. Travis called his moms, and got [[Catherine Scott]] to represent Zoe in court. The initial day didn't go well, with Summer being dismissed for inappropriate behavior and Liberty being horrible at public speaking. The [[Judge|judge]] declared the case inconclusive, but Liberty had a plan. With [[Beatrice Stark]] on their side, Liberty wanted her to use her powers to brainwash the judge, but Beatrice failed, and instead had to pivot to a secondary plan- posing as Jo, who refused to appear in court and defend Zoe because of the way she'd treated Giovanna. All of Liberty's plans were ultimately meaningless, as Giovanna herself ended up walking into the courtroom, and sat down on Zoe's side of the floor. That was all the judge needed to rule in Zoe's favor. In revenge, Patel withdrew a significant amount of money from Zoe's bank account, driving the family into bankruptcy. Zoe forced Travis to embezzle funds again, and this time, with Beatrice on their side, they got away with it.

> Zoe and Giovanna spend time together.

Zoe spent the remainder of her days enjoying her success and the process of developing a story alongside Giovanna. She regularly battled with the mind fog Melody had instilled in her mind, wanting more than anything to return to the original Zoe instead of the new Zoe that she saw as weak. As part of this process, she started to develop a new personality that sat between the two, and it was in this state of mind when she began plans for the [[Presley School of Excellency]], wanting to give something back to the world. She also started to feel a level of guilt for what she'd done to Giovanna.

> Zoe enters the Sylvan Glade.

When Summer wandered into [[Sylvan Glade]], Zoe dedicated herself to finding her, and was the first to do so. Summer was later afflicted with the Sylvan Curse, and began to age rapidly. Using her celebrity, Zoe reached out to [[Bella Goth|Bella]] and [[Mortimer Goth]] to ask for advice, as their family knew all about Willow Creek. They told her that the only way to reverse the curse was to offer another life up in return. Zoe, who had come to realize that nearly every negative thing that had happened to the family, from Giovanna's mental state, to Travis's criminal record, to scaring [[José Yépez]], which resulted in Liberty leaving for space with Beatrice and leaving their children without a mother. The list was endless, and Zoe firmly believed that if anyone should offer up their life for Summer, it was her.

#### Legacy

> ![[S.2.1.7.png]] 
> The opening ceremony for the Presley School of Excellency.

When Zoe passed, she cemented her status as a celebrity, and managed to rehabilitate her image into someone that cared about others. The Presley School of Excellency opened a few days after her passing, named in her honor. It became a prestigious school with an emphasis on arts, and entry for students was always competitive. Giovanna enjoyed the celebrity status Zoe had given her through *A Day in the Life of Granny*, and became a well loved figure worldwide.

Zoe's funeral was attended by numerous celebrities and important figures, the most relevant of which being [[Kayla Brooks]], another prominent figure in the writing world. Zoe had written her for advice back when she was still struggling to get her work published, and while Kayla hadn't responded back then, she wished to pay her respects to a fellow respected author.

## Personality
The original Zoe was domineering and entirely self-interested. Nothing was too far to her if it would result in greater success in her career and an increase in her level of fame. She felt no guilt for what she did to [[Giovanna Cardwell|Giovanna]] or what she asked of [[Travis Scott|Travis]]. After [[Melody Roach|Melody]]'s hypnotherapy, this personality only emerged whenever Zoe felt threatened. She was furiously defensive of the life that she felt she'd earned, and [[Zoe Patel|Patel]] trying to take it from her filled her with an intense rage.

Post hypnotherapy Zoe was somewhat ditzy, and was generally simply happy about life. She actually enjoyed spending an excessive amount of time with Giovanna, and the two would chat for hours. The energy that had driven her before seemed almost missing, and Zoe became largely passive.

Zoe's final personality emerged as she struggled to rid herself of the fog that brought about her hypnotherapy personality. She missed her original self, and how she got things done, but she began to recognize how she'd wronged people. She also noticed that no one respected her hypnotherapy personality. To remedy both of these issues, Zoe dedicated herself to giving back and helping out the people in her life to the best she could, ultimately resulting in her giving her life for [[Summer Holiday|Summer]].

## Trivia
- The [[Sylvan Glade]] Zoe trading her life for [[Summer Holiday|Summer]]'s actually occurred in gameplay. Summer accidentally blew out some birthday candles early and became an elder, and that wasn't acceptable so we aged her back. Zoe, on the other hand, had been with us forever, so we cheated her into an elder, unaware that it kept the age progression bar filled from the previous life state, and she immediately died.
