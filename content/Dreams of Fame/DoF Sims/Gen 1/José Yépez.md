**José Yépez** is a character introduced in the first chapter of [[Dreams of Fame]]. 

## Profile
José and his sister [[Jadyn Yépez|Jadyn]] had a quiet, conservative childhood where they were taught to be kind to others and to stick firmly to their own moral boundaries. They were peaceful years for the two of them, where José would quietly strum his guitar while Jadyn did her artwork.

As they grew older, José and Jadyn drifted apart, and José turned to the guitar as a career. It wasn't easy, and he spent most of his time on the job handing out business cards to random people. One of those people happened to be [[Summer Holiday]], who José saw crying at the [[Club Lounge]]. Recognizing that she was hurting and completely alone, José offered her a business card not as a guitarist, but as a shoulder to cry on.

> José and Summer have a night out.

It took years for Summer to finally follow-up on his offer and give him a call, but she hit such a low point in her life that she had no one else to turn to. While José didn't remember Summer at first, once she sent a selfie, it all came rushing back, and he set time aside to talk to her. He could tell that she needed it. Within a week, she had invited him over to [[Presley House|her home]], and within a year, the two were officially dating. Their early relationship consisted of nights where they went out to lounges and evenings where Summer would visit [[José's House]] and dance as he strummed his guitar.

However, there was a moment early on in their relationship where José saw [[Beatrice Stark]] brainwash [[Cassandra Goth]], and no one in Summer's family seemed to have any issue with it. It was a moment that weighed on José, yet in the interest of keeping Summer happy, José buried his concerns. Eventually, a date night came that changed everything. Summer told José that he'd originally been a rebound for her after she realized [[Travis Scott]] would never love her, which was news that deeply wounded José, as he thought that she was over Travis by the time they began dating.

He asked Summer to leave, then went to consider the ring he'd planned on using to propose that night. As he considered his history with Summer, his previous concerns about Beatrice resurfaced, and he finally chose to stand by his moral code, and go to the [[President’s Mansion]] to turn her in. At the President’s Mansion, José met with the secretary, [[Zoe Patel]], who was, unknown to him at the time, an enemy of the Presley family. She had him make a public report, then, recognizing that she could hurt Summer by dating José, chose to pursue him romantically. José turned her down at every opportunity.

> José and Zoe search for Summer.

When José returned to the Presley House to apologize to Summer and the rest of the family, he and everyone home at the time came to realize that she'd gone missing for 24 hours. While everyone in that house disliked José at the time, they decided to put it aside while they tried to locate Summer. Consumed with guilt, José dedicated himself fully to the search. With enough time and effort, the aid of [[Zoe Presley]], and being in the right place at the right time, José managed to stumble his way into [[Sylvan Glade]] and find Summer. While Summer was in the [[Willow Creek Hospital|hospital]], he apologized profusely, and proposed.

> José and Summer are officially wed.

José and Summer had their wedding at the [[Blue Velvet]], a local bar Summer adored. The space was intricately decorated for the event, and everyone they knew attended the ceremony. After the wedding, José moved in, and helped out Travis with parenting his children. Life was good for a time, a time period in which Summer got pregnant with [[Nash Holiday|Nash]], but all of that was brought to a screeching halt when Summer was afflicted with the Sylvan Curse.

José and the rest of their family dedicated themselves to finding out what was wrong with Summer. Everyone used their skills and connections to find a solution, but what saved Summer in the end was Zoe Presley being willing to offer up her life in return for Summer's, transferring the curse from Summer to her. In the days that led up to Zoe's funeral, Summer gave birth to Nash.

## Personality
José is a man who values peace and honesty. He always wants to do what he believes to be right, and when he screws up, he'll admit it, and even go on a full apology tour if the situation requires it. His relationship with the Presleys tests his values and his patience, as nearly everyone in that house lacks the moral code he applies to his understanding of the world. For the sake of [[Summer Holiday|Summer]], and later [[Nash Holiday|Nash]], however, he'll endure anything he must.

José cares deeply for others, and that care isn't reserved for just his loved ones. If someone's down, or in need, he'll be there to offer a helping hand, and if he says he cares about someone, he truly means it. José also expects the same in return from those he cares about, however, which was the primary reason Summer not having been completely honest with him at the start of their relationship was such a big deal for him.
