The unnamed **Judge** is a character in the first chapter of [[Dreams of Fame]]. She presides over the case of Zoe v. Zoe.

## Profile
The judge presides over the [[Willow Creek Courthouse]]. When [[Zoe Patel]] sued [[Zoe Presley]] for the rights to the *A Day in the Life of Granny* book series, she was tasked with ruling on the case. After the initial proceedings, she ruled that the results were inconclusive. On the following day, she was knocked out by [[Beatrice Stark]], but she kept things running efficiently.

What ultimately decided her ruling on the case was the entrance of [[Giovanna Cardwell]], who sat on Zoe Presley's side of the courtroom. That was all the evidence she needed, because as a secret fan of the books and Giovanna in particular, she knew that sitting near Zoe by itself was enough of a statement. She secured an autograph from Giovanna, and later showed up to the opening of the [[Presley School of Excellency]] many years later and grabbed another autograph there.
