**Zoe Patel** is a character in the first chapter of [[Dreams of Fame]]. She and [[Zoe Presley]] are regularly confused for each other because of their names.

## Profile

> Patel sees Giovanna and her husband in her home.

Zoe Patel was living with roommates in her home in [[Oasis Springs]] when she first encountered [[Giovanna Cardwell]] and her [[Granny's Husband|husband]]. Her roommates were all out of town when she got back from yoga late one night, and ran into the pair hanging out in her home. She chased them out of her house, and was going to let things go until she saw foreign hair in her own bed.

> Patel tracks down Giovanna.

Patel went directly to the police, and demanded a search for the strange woman and her husband. Using security footage from Patel's cameras, the policeman was able to find them nearby. With Patel in his passenger seat, they chased the pair all the way to [[Willow Creek]], where they found Giovanna at her [[Giovanna's Husband's Grave|husband's grave]]. Feeling sympathetic for the poor woman, Patel chose not to press charges.

> Patel appears on the news.

Having possession of the security footage from that night ended up benefitting Patel greatly later in her life. Jobless and with roommates who hounded her for it, Patel began to pay attention to a book series titled *A Day in the Life of Granny*, published by a Zoe P. She found it ironic that this Zoe P could almost be her. What really got her thinking was when she finally cracked open one of those books, and read a section where this Granny was tailed by a policeman and a bitter woman after she slept in her bed, who she then beat up. Patel began to connect the dots, and, upon realizing that the true author, this [[Zoe Presley]], was pretending that Granny wasn't a real person. Patel saw her opportunity and leaped for it, and was on the news by the next morning claiming that Zoe Presley had stolen her work.

> Patel addresses the Judge in court.

Patel sued Zoe for the rights to *A Day in the Life of Granny*, launching a lengthy court battle. Zoe was represented by [[Catherine Scott]], while Patel chose to represent herself, yet neither side made much headway at first. Catherine's witnesses were horrendous, and Patel failed to make a single decent point. The [[Judge|judge]] declared the results of the first day inconclusive, and asked both sides to bring Giovanna into the [[Willow Creek Courthouse|courtroom]]. Neither side was able to do so, yet the case was ironically decided when Giovanna showed up by herself, and sat down on Zoe's side of the courtroom. Patel left the building screaming.

> Patel arrives at the [[Presley House]].

Before the results of the case went public, Patel used their frequently mistaken identities to dip into Zoe's bank account and drain it of funds. She then dropped off the face of the earth for a few years. Her next gig was working as a secretary for [[Mitch Laurent]] at the [[President’s Mansion]]. It was a job that [[Cassandra Goth]], President Laurent's personal secretary had hired her for somewhat maliciously, as she was not a fan of President Laurent. It was while working job, which Patel had quickly come to hate, that she ran into [[José Yépez]], who wanted to report that an alien named [[Beatrice Stark]] had wiped the memory of Cassandra. Patel took it from a personal report to President Laurent to a public spectacle that she was sure to personally involve herself in that forced Beatrice to flee the planet and return to [[Sixam]].

> Patel and José argue.

Rather pleased with herself and recognizing that José was having romantic troubles with [[Summer Holiday]], a dear friend of Zoe's that she remembered from court, Patel chose to pursue José herself. She drove herself down to the Presley House to tell Summer personally. Summer went missing after hearing the news, but Patel wasn't too bothered, and showed up to [[José's House]] to woo him anyway. Shocked and horrified when he turned her down, Patel left, but she hadn't given up hope yet. Her dreams were shattered a couple days later when Summer was found and she showed up to the [[Willow Creek Hospital|hospital]] to antagonize her, but instead walked in on José proposing her. Patel, once again, left screaming.

## Personality
An incredibly vindictive woman, Patel can't really motivate herself unless she sees easy financial gain or if she hates the person. She quickly reached that point with [[Zoe Presley]]. After losing the court case, she dedicated the rest of her life to trying to ruin her and her family, even relocating to [[Willow Creek]] so she could be nearby just incase opportunity struck. She loves to put others down with cruel jabs, and delights in anything that might knock Zoe down a peg or two.

Patel loves to seek out the spotlight, and both the *A Day in the Life of Granny* and [[Beatrice Stark|Beatrice]] situations allowed her to make very public facing statements that reached a wide audience. Situations like those feed into her ego, and validate her sense of entitlement. In Zoe Patel's mind, she can do no wrong.
