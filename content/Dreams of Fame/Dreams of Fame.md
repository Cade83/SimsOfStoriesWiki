## Chapter 1: A Painter and an Author
>*When Giovanna first met Zoe, she had no idea what she was about to get into. Zoe, who'd always dreamed of being a famous author, will do anything to achieve her goals. It won't be easy for her, as the roommates she asks to move in with her prove to be more of a hinderance than a help, each with deep issues. Zoe will have to realize that what goes around comes around, and that there's a lot more out there than she was ever aware of.*

## Chapter 2: Super Villains and Pianists
>*As Clara, Jacob, and Summer's son, Nash, grow up fast, Liberty feels like she's losing time with children while she attempts to rescue Beatrice. She'll do whatever she has to do to spend more time with them, as all three develop very different lives. Clara quickly becomes legendary for her sharp tongue and lack of self control, while Jacob is a comforting presence for all, entertaining those around him with jokes and music. Nash becomes one with the popular crowd, and uses Summer's own fame as a catalyst for his own.*
