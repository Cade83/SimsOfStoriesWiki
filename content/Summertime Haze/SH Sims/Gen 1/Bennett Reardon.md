**Bennett Reardon** is one of the protagonists of the first chapter of [[Summertime Haze]]. He lives across the street from [[Henry Doyle]].

## Profile
Bennett grew up rather privileged as the son of [[Alina Reardon|Alina]] and [[Layne Reardon]], who were, in their time, two of the best on [[Willow Creek]]'s police force. Both had larger than life reputations, which followed both Bennett and his younger sister [[Regan Reardon|Regan]] as they grew up.

> Bennett welcomes Henry to the neighborhood.

As a teenager, Bennett chose to pursue art. He went to college, got his art degree, then moved back home, as nothing came of it. He agonized over his portfolio, and tried his best to form a clientele, forever grateful that his parents let him live at home for all of it. It was during this time that [[Henry Doyle]] moved in [[Crespo House|across the street]], and Bennett was tasked with welcoming him to the neighborhood. The two of them had an altogether unpleasant first meeting, with Bennett insulting Henry's furniture and Henry shouting back.

> Bennett hangs out with Henry.

At the insistence of his parents, Bennett made nice with Henry, and invited him over to [[Reardon House|his place]]. This second time around, Bennett and Henry actually clicked, and soon became good friends. They were visiting each other regularly, texting and calling all the time, and Henry had even offered to design a portfolio for Bennett. Their closeness seemingly confused Henry, as he suddenly kissed Bennett when they were spending time together. Bennett forgave Henry, as he valued him too much as a friend to let him go, but he was sure to let Henry know that he didn't like him in that way.

> People Against Ellen meets for the first time.

While they were still on good terms, Henry distanced himself from Bennett for a while. It wasn't until Henry began erecting a wall around the house that they reconnected, and after hearing what Henry had been through recently, he suggested that Henry confide in good friends like himself, inspiring Henry's People Against [[Ellen Bowers|Ellen]] group. As this group began meeting, Bennett bonded with Henry's friends [[Jordan Crespo]] and [[Toby Baxter]], and soon found himself developing feelings for Jordan. Henry picked up on Bennett's feelings for Jordan, and it became a minor point of contention, as Bennett also felt as if Henry had never abandoned feelings he had for Toby, and they both used their theories against each other.

> Bennett tells off Regan.

As Henry's group became closer, Bennett became increasingly frustrated with Regan. He felt as if he always had to look out for her and sacrifice himself for her, all of which culminated in him refusing to allow her to join his friend group in a heated discussion between the two of them. Jordan suggested that Regan was just lashing out to separate herself from her family, which was a theory Bennett quickly accepted as the truth. Not long after, Regan ran away from home, and Bennett, his parents, and his friends were unable to find any leads. While he was worried about her, Bennett buried those fears.

> Bennett publicly asks out Jordan.

As time passed, Bennett's closeness with Henry's group and desire to move out eventually culminated in him moving in with Henry. Jordan moved in with them not long after, and his relationship with her progressed quickly from that day on. They spent most of their time together and even began secretly sleeping together. Ironically, because Henry had spent so much time teasing Bennett and Jordan's friend [[Hope Peck]] had spent so much time doing the same to her, both of them kept it quiet entirely because they knew the two of them would be obnoxious. Regardless, when confronted one day, Bennett snapped and admitted the truth, and the two of them became very publicly affectionate from that day forward.

## Personality
Bennett is generally a pretty laid-back guy, and it shows in every aspect of his life. His career as a painter dragged for years, he wanted to move out of his [[Reardon House|parent's house]] for years but couldn't be bothered to make it happen, and in holding out on revealing his relationship with [[Jordan Crespo|Jordan]] to avoid messy conversations. He's so laid-back that it borders on conflict averse. Bennett was the only dissenting voice when Jordan pushed crashing [[Hayley Baxter]]'s funeral.

That changes, however, when it comes to [[Regan Reardon|Regan]]. The two of them naturally irritate each other, and raised voices are common. Part of this could also be due to his general lack of social awareness- he can be unintentionally rude at times, and as he grew up, he chose to simply avoid potentially awkward situations over forcing himself into them. This is also why he stopped mentioning Regan when she wasn't found- nothing was changing with that situation, and he didn't want to bring the mood down, so best to bury his concerns.

Bennett also sticks up for his friends, having stepped in as [[Henry Doyle|Henry]]'s friend when he recognized he really needed it, even shouting at [[Ellen Bowers|Ellen]] for his sake. He gives good advice, and is there for emotional support whenever it's needed. Both he and Jordan are willing to drop anything to be there for a friend-in-need, and it's that energy that likely drew them together.
