> Toby and Reese meet with the officer.

With the coroner's office ruling that [[Hayley Baxter]]'s death was not an accident, the officer was tasked with looking into her death. It was an investigation that was wanted by [[Toby Baxter]], her husband, so the officer worked alongside him and close family friend [[Reese Inda]] throughout the investigation. He started out by meeting with the both of them in [[Baxter House|Toby's home]] to see what they knew, as Toby was in the lobby of the [[Willow Creek Hospital|hospital]] on the night of the crime.

> The officer questions suspects.

The officer was eventually able to identify three suspects who were seen at the hospital that night with no valid reason to be there: [[Travis Scott]], [[Liberty Lee]], and [[Summer Holiday]]. He brought them down to the [[Willow Creek Police Station|station]] for questioning, and invited Toby and Reese to observe from behind a one way window. All three suspects had airtight alibis placing them at the [[Club Lounge]], and the case ran cold there. The officer had to break the news to Toby and Reese, and witness Toby's wrath.
