## Profile
As the only son of a prominent family in [[Oasis Springs]], Toby started high school with wealth that helped him elevate his social status. His outgoing personality and good looks only elevated him further, and by his senior year, he'd become the quarterback of the football team. At the same time, he was a star member of the Mathletes. As someone with both the brains and the brawn, Toby was desired school-wide, so he naturally gravitated towards the head cheerleader and president of student government, [[Hayley Baxter|Hayley]]. They were the only two who could match each other. Due to their prominence, they were asked to guide [[Paolo Rocca]] when came to study from abroad, and the three of them became a strong trio.

After high school, Toby went to trade school to be the primary breadwinner while Hayley started a mommy blog and networked. Within a year, they were wed and had purchased a [[Baxter House|home]] in [[Willow Creek]] with their parents' money. Hayley was able to land Toby a job at the high end [[Willow Creek Gym]] with her connections, and soon enough, [[Jennifer Baxter|Jennifer]] and [[Nathan Baxter|Nathan]] were born. Hayley stayed at home while Toby worked every day, and the two of them became respected members of their [[First Church of Our Mother|church]] and community. Life settled into a routine, and they were content.
