**Toby Baxter** is one of the protagonists of the first chapter of [[Summertime Haze]]. He's the husband of [[Hayley Baxter]].

## Profile
As the only son of a prominent family in [[Oasis Springs]], Toby started high school with wealth that helped him elevate his social status. His outgoing personality and good looks only elevated him further, and by his senior year, he'd become the quarterback of the football team. At the same time, he was a star member of the Mathletes. As someone with both the brains and the brawn, Toby was desired school-wide, so he naturally gravitated towards the head cheerleader and president of student government, [[Hayley Baxter|Hayley]]. They were the only two who could match each other. Due to their prominence, they were asked to guide [[Paolo Rocca]] when came to study from abroad, and the three of them became a strong trio.

After high school, Toby went to trade school to be the primary breadwinner while Hayley started a mommy blog and networked. Within a year, they were wed and had purchased a [[Baxter House|home]] in [[Willow Creek]] with their parents' money. Hayley was able to land Toby a job at the high end [[Willow Creek Gym]] with her connections, and soon enough, [[Jennifer Baxter|Jennifer]] and [[Nathan Baxter|Nathan]] were born. Hayley stayed at home while Toby worked every day, and the two of them became respected members of their [[First Church of Our Mother|church]] and community. Life settled into a routine, and they were content.

> Toby follows Henry up to the bar.

Things began to change for Toby when he noticed a boy checking him out at the gym. While he initially wrote it off, assuming he'd never see him again, the boy came back one day and this time, he was crying. Toby approached him, wanting to tell him off for checking him out and let him know he was happily married, but he couldn't help but feel bad for him. The boy introduced himself as [[Henry Doyle]] and Toby accompanied him up to the rooftop bar where [[Jordan Crespo]] worked, sensing that he was hurt and needed someone. At that bar, Henry spilled all of his trauma to Toby and Jordan and by the end of the day, they agreed to keep in touch.

> Toby spends time over at Henry's house.

When he got hope that night, he mentioned Henry to Hayley and she shot down the idea of him being friends with him, insisting that he wouldn't be a good model for Jennifer and Nathan. Toby, however, ignored her and started spending time at [[Crespo House|Henry's house]] with Jordan and another friend of Henry's, [[Bennett Reardon]]. He felt bad for Henry- he clearly needed people in his life. Initially, Toby kept Hayley away from his new friends for personal reasons he didn't fully understand, but she forced her way in. Once Paolo started spending time with them as well, Hayley was forced to tolerate Toby's friends and Toby was forced to include her. At this point, Toby started inviting Henry and the others over for dinner on occasion.

> Toby kisses Henry.

As Toby spent an ever increasing amount of time with Henry, he began to question himself. He wondered what had driven him to spend time with him that day at the gym, why he'd kept texting him after, and, above all, why he enjoyed his company so much. Toby had begun to have realizations about himself that put his entire life up to that point in question. He began to wonder if he was even happy being married to Hayley. One evening, something came over Toby and he got Henry alone and kissed him. Once the deed was done, he was filled with horror. He couldn't believe what he'd done, and he couldn't believe that he'd enjoyed it.

> Toby lies to Hayley.

Henry told Toby that he would not do anything further with him until he told Hayley everything and ended it with her. Toby fully intended on doing so, but he was unable to find the words so he ended up lying to both Hayley and Henry for about a week. This was all brought to an abrupt end when Hayley collapsed on the kitchen floor and Toby had to rush her to the [[Willow Creek Hospital|hospital]]. The [[Doctor|doctor]] told Toby that she'd had a heart attack and Toby immediately began to blame himself. He hit up [[Reese Inda]]- an old friend of Hayley's- for help then went to church to seek guidance. After praying on it, Toby decided that he couldn't let Henry distract him from his family, so he cut him off.

> Toby comes out to Reese.

With Hayley in the hospital, his overwhelming guilt, and suddenly having to parent two kids by himself, Toby spiraled hard. He stopped going to work and spent most of his time either by Hayley's hospital bed or at church. He'd head scripture, trying to convince himself that homosexuality wasn't a sin. Reese helped out when she could, and Toby, recognizing that he needed to start telling people the truth, started out with Reese. His next step was to tell Hayley, yet even once she woke up, Toby struggled to find the words.

> Toby admits the truth to Hayley.

When he finally did manage to work up the courage to tell her, Hayley's reaction was worse than Toby ever imagined with her telling him that she never wished to see him again. He went straight to church and prayed, looking for guidance. While there, he ran into [[Ellen Bowers]], who convinced Toby that being a father was more important than a budding relationship with Henry. Toby went and met with [[Melody Roach]], a hypnotherapist, and begged her to fix him, but she refused. Melody insisted that his family would adapt.

> Toby's final moments with Hayley.

Toby rushed to the hospital, desperate to try to at least convince Hayley that he could be an acquaintance of hers. Unfortunately for Toby, he was too late. Hayley had passed away due to a case of medical malpractice, and the words Toby had for her would be forever unspoken. With Reese's assistance, Toby led Hayley's funeral and had an awkward moment when Henry and his friends showed up uninvited. Henry insisted that Toby needed his friends, especially right now, and the words got through to Toby before Reese ushered Henry and his friends out. When Henry dropped by Toby's house a while later, reiterating the same point, all Toby could tell him was that he was thinking about it.

> Toby reacts to the news that they're out of leads.

Determined to get to the bottom of Hayley's death, Toby asked Reese to join him in the investigation process. Reese begrudgingly agreed, and they met with an [[Officer|officer]] to go over what they knew. The officer was able to identify three suspects, and he permitted Toby and Reese to sit behind the one-sided glass and observe his questioning of the suspects. The questioning didn't unearth any new info outside of all three of the suspects having airtight alibis. The officer declared the case cold, much to Toby's dismay.

## Personality
Toby is a man who spends a lot of time living in his own head. He has the ability to internalize and repress things, which was a skill he developed out of necessity as his relationship with [[Hayley Baxter|Hayley]] continued to progress back in high school. Any doubts had to be silenced- they were meant to be, and there was no questioning that. Regardless, he remains open-minded and kind even to those he might disagree with on a personal or religious level. Toby's ability to internalize is a double-edged sword, however, as when forced to confront those doubts he wages an internal war with himself.

Once Toby calls someone family, he has a great deal of love for them. When he finally admitted to himself that he'd fallen for [[Henry Doyle|Henry]], his family was one of his few holdups. He loved his perfect life with Hayley, [[Jennifer Baxter|Jennifer]], and [[Nathan Baxter|Nathan]], his gorgeous [[Baxter House|home]], his career... He'd been able to envision the rest of his life from the moment Jennifer was born, and he was more than content. Henry threw all of that into question, and as he came to love Henry and envision him as future family as well, Toby was thrown into into internal conflict. If given the option, he would have happily abandoned all he'd realized about himself to continue living his idyllic life with his wife and kids.

Toby is also a very devout man. He attended [[First Church of Our Mother|church]] every Sunday with his family and being a respected member of that community was a source of pride for him. When Toby began to question his sexuality and his ability to be faithful to his wife, his faith stood in direct opposition to his capability to embrace who he truly was. He reviewed scripture multiple times, trying to find a way not to hate himself.
