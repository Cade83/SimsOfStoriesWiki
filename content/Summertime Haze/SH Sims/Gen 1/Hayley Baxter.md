**Hayley Baxter** is a character in the first chapter of [[Summertime Haze]]. She's the wife of [[Toby Baxter]].

## Profile
Born into a wealthy family, Hayley attended high school in [[Oasis Springs]] where she quickly rose to the top of the food chain, aided by the elaborate parties she threw for everyone she liked. She auditioned for the cheerleaders early on, and by her senior year, she enjoyed all the popularity that came with being head cheerleader. At the same time, she ran for student government and was elected as the student body president with ease, becoming close with fellow cheerleader and student government member [[Reese Inda]] in the process. As head cheerleader and student body president, she naturally gravitated towards the quarterback of the football team and star of the Mathletes, [[Toby Baxter|Toby]], and the pair of them quickly became an item. Due to their prominence, they were asked to guide [[Paolo Rocca]] when came to study from abroad, and the three of them became a strong trio.

After high school, while Toby went to trade school, Hayley started a mommy blog and networked, and within a year, they were wed and had purchased a [[Baxter House|home]] in [[Willow Creek]] with their parents' money. With her connections, she got Toby a job at the high end [[Willow Creek Gym]] while she devoted herself to being a housewife, mother to [[Jennifer Baxter|Jennifer]] and [[Nathan Baxter|Nathan]], and a respected and devout member of her community and the [[First Church of Our Mother]]. Life settled into a routine, and Hayley was content.

Things began to change when Toby met [[Henry Doyle]] at the gym. Hayley disapproved of his friendship with Henry, as he didn't align with their religious values and had expressed a romantic interest in Toby. Regardless, Toby began spending time with Henry and his friends, started asking that they have Henry over for dinner, and he even dragged Paolo into Henry's friend group. Hayley, however, was kept at a distance. Pushed to her brink, she forcibly inserted herself into Henry's friend group and gradually became acquainted with everyone. With time, she came to enjoy their company, and they began to consider her as one of their own, even if it was as more of on the fringe than as a core member of the group.

Unbeknownst to Hayley, Toby had fallen deeply in love with Henry, and had begun to realize things about himself. It was the morning after he kissed Henry that Hayley's heart gave out. Toby rushed her to the [[Willow Creek Hospital|hospital]], where she sat in a comma. [[Doctor|The doctor]] discovered that due to her genetics, Hayley had a weak heart. When she woke up, Hayley discovered that her old friend Reese had stepped in as a secondary guardian for Jennifer and Nathan in her absence. Toby himself behaved oddly, and Hayley couldn't piece together the reason why.

Eventually, Toby finally worked up the nerve to tell everything to Hayley. So much finally made sense to her the first time- Toby's fixation on Paolo back in high school, him wanting to spend so much time with Henry, his behavior since she'd found herself in the hospital... Furious and fully expecting to die in the hospital, Hayley demanded that Toby leave her life for good, and he ran away crying. Amazingly, Hayley started to recover, and was expected to be on her feet and able to live normally again, but her life was cut short when a drunk [[Summer Holiday]] mistakingly gave her the wrong medication.

#### Legacy
Hayley's death shook Toby to his core. He tried to redevote himself to religion and his family, but he'd gone too far down the path that led away from it. Regardless, with Reese's assistance, he tried his best to be a father to Jennifer and Nathan and hosted the funeral Hayley would have wanted. It was crashed by Henry and his friends, but Reese ensured that they made a speedy exit.

Toby also sought out Hayley's killer. He knew that her death hadn't been natural, and partnered with Reese to get to the bottom of things. The [[Officer|officer]] in charge of the case identified who had been at the hospital the night Hayley died, and allowed Toby and Reese to sit in as he questioned the primary three suspects. Unfortunately for the Baxters, those suspects all had an airtight alibi, and without anyone else to suspect, the case went cold.

## Personality
A deeply religious woman, Hayley is dedicated to living out a traditional, perfect life. High school afforded her every opportunity to do so, as her wealth and popularity landed her the most popular guy in the school and what she believed was her perfect match in [[Toby Baxter|Toby]]. With Toby, Hayley was able to construct her perfect life- she was respected at the [[First Church of Our Mother]], beloved in her community, had a gorgeous home, and had two wonderful children in [[Jennifer Baxter|Jennifer]] and [[Nathan Baxter|Nathan]].

As a stay-at-home mom, Hayley is willing to do anything to support her family, whether that's as small as taking the kids to their extracurriculars or hiring a tutor, or being willing to give [[Henry Doyle|Henry]] and his friends a chance at Toby's urging. She can react with force when needed, such as when she invited herself into Henry's home, but she excels in being a host and a mother.

Hayley's biggest flaw is that her desire for her perfect life and perfect family can blind her. [[Reese Inda|Reese]] warned her numerous times about her suspicions about Toby's sexuality, but Hayley threatened to cut her off over entertaining the idea. She ignored all the hints with [[Paolo Rocca|Paolo]] and Henry as well, operating with a dangerous degree of blindness.
