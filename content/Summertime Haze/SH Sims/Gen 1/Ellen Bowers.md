> “Don’t you *dare* speak to me that way Henry. Trying to alter who you are? Please. After everything I’ve done for you, I thought it’d be clear that I am only trying to help you. All I’ve ever wanted is the best for you Henry, and let’s face it- Toby Baxter isn’t it. Neither is that mohawked neighbor!"

**Ellen Bowers** is a character in the first chapter of [[Summertime Haze]].

## Profile
Ellen chose to become a school counselor because she cared a lot about helping children, and being a voice of reason when they couldn't find one themselves. She worked for many years at [[Newcrest High]], and was nearing retirement age when her husband passed away unexpectedly. Ellen grieved of course, but in her grief, she buried herself in her work even more than she typically would have, and came to enjoy the sense of control it gave her, over both her life and their own. Most of the kids she helped showed no appreciation for her hard work, so when [[Henry Doyle]] did, she began to give him special attention. He was a boy with no friends who often took his lunch with school staff, and she decided that out of everyone at Newcrest High, he clearly needed her guidance most.

> Ellen meets with Jadyn.

Ellen was present when [[Tatiana Long]] outed Henry, and was one of the first to notice when he didn't return to school the next day. With his graduation only weeks away, Ellen was determined to get Henry back on track, she knew he had to amount to more than a highs school dropout. She started her search by meeting with his mother, [[Jadyn Yépez]],  but she was as in the dark as Ellen was. Ellen then began to call around, and eventually got in touch with the driver of the bus Henry boarded when he left town. At that point, it was just a matter of looking into property ownership in [[Willow Creek]], at which point she found Henry.

> Ellen visits Henry at his [[Crespo House|home]].

She approached Henry with the offer of securing him his high school diploma, insisting that he needed it to be successful in life. Henry agreed, and Ellen got to work. In the process of forging test scores and getting his information, Ellen realized that it was safer if she handled everything, and she began renting a [[Ellen's House|home]] and attending a [[First Church of Our Mother|local church]] in Willow Creek. She came to love Willow Creek, and as she was already near retiring, she resigned from her position at Newcrest High, and bought her rental. It was during this time when Ellen saw Henry kissing [[Bennett Reardon]] while on her way to church, convincing her that Henry would still need her guidance even after she got him his diploma. In her mind, Bennett was unrefined, and, as a religious woman, she also wasn't fond of the fact that Henry was interested in a man.

> Henry returns from [[Melody's Therapy]].

Ellen was able to pressure Henry into attending a church service with her by leveraging his diploma. After service, Henry dragged her along to the [[Willow Creek Gym]], where she eventually realized that they'd only ended up there because Henry was stalking [[Toby Baxter]]. Ellen was sure to tell Henry that Toby had a [[Hayley Baxter|wife]], then, after giving him his diploma, she set up an appointment with [[Melody Roach]] for him, having heard rumors about her talents. Ellen met with Melody privately, and told her that she wanted her to use her hypnotherapy on Henry to ensure that he no longer fell for men. With enough pressure, Melody gave in. However, when Henry came back, it became clear than Melody had told him about her true aims, as Henry was furious. He slapped her across the face, and told her to never speak to him again before storming out of the house. Devastated, Ellen cried for hours before she moved into a new phase of her plan, which involved dialing [[Jaxon Kauker]]'s number.

Convincing Jaxon that she'd dedicated herself to trying to get through to Henry so they could all make amends, she directed Jaxon to [[Crespo House|Henry's house]], hoping he could get through to him and eventually bring Henry back to her, but it only made things worse. Instead, Henry increased his security, and Ellen was forced to come up with a new plan. Needing a lock of his hair, she waited around outside his house, hoping he'd have a reason to open his door, but when the opportunity finally came, Bennett opened the door instead. With her plans ruined, Ellen retreated and met with Jaxon at the park to regroup and go forward with another plan.

> Ellen researches at the Archives.

Ellen moved into doing extensive research at the [[Willow Creek Archives]], where she looked into old Willow Creek myths and legends. She became such a frequent visitor that she was offered a job at the library, which she took on gratefully. At around this time, [[Regan Reardon]] ran away from her family and approached Ellen, determined to break her brother, [[Bennett Reardon|Bennett]], away from Henry. She brought in her friends [[Mallory Fuchs]] and [[Owain Fitzpatrick]] as well.

> The Witch of the Willow reviews Ellen's memories.

Utilizing Mallory and Owain to scope out Henry's house, Ellen broke in and took a lock of Henry's hair, just as an ancient book she'd discovered instructed. With the hair, Ellen went deep into the bayou and wandered until she came across a [[Witch of the Willow’s Swamp|residence deep in the forest]]. Once there, she met with the [[Elaine Oldham|Witch of the Willow]], who asked that Ellen reconsider her intentions. The two of them looked over Ellen's relationship with Henry, and the Witch of the Willow accused Ellen of being selfish, then refused to help her. The words rang true, and Ellen gradually realized that her helping Henry was all to her own benefit.

## Personality
Ellen is a very intense woman. Once she settles on a goal, she pursues it relentlessly until its achieved. It's a trait that served her well professionally, as she was able to get to the bottom of a student's problems and correct them. It's also a trait that led to her direction after her husband's passing, as she dedicated a significant amount of her life to trying to help [[Henry Doyle|Henry]]. As a deeply religious woman, Henry's same-sex attraction, especially to [[Toby Baxter|Toby]], a married man, bothered her deeply and she wanted to correct it at all costs.

Once focused on an issue, Ellen's moral boundaries continue to lower the longer she spends wrestling with a particular issue. With Henry, she progressed from trying to help him at school, to befriending him, to hypnotherapy, and eventually breaking and entering, spells, and kidnapping.

Ellen is ultimately a very broken woman. The passing of her husband destroyed her, but in the days after, she threw herself so heavily into her work that it replaced him. The intensity with which she tries to help kids acts as a substitute to the love she had for her husband and her desire to have a family and leave a lasting impact on the world. Ellen simply wanted to feel appreciated, and with Henry showing an unusual level of appreciation for her, she set herself on correcting him. None of this is anything Ellen is aware of herself, however. She rarely ever looks inward and considers what she's actually feeling.
