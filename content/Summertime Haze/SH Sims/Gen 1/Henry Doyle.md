**Henry Doyle** is the protagonist of the first chapter of [[Summertime Haze]].

## Profile
As an infant, Henry was left on the doorstep of a church that [[Jadyn Yépez]] attended religiously. She ended up taking care of him temporarily as a favor to the church, and with time, she came to care for him as her own son. She purchased a [[Jadyn's House|home]] in [[Newcrest]], and raised Henry there. Henry enjoyed the perfect childhood under her care.

> Henry is outed at school.

As a teenager, Henry's perfect childhood morphed into loneliness. He had a great relationship with Jadyn, but struggled to connect with others at [[Newcrest High|school]].  His closest confidant in high school was [[Ellen Bowers]], the school counselor, and when he finally felt as if he had a friend in [[Tatiana Long]], she outed him to the school when he chose to confide in her. Unwilling to return to that school, Henry packed up his things, left a note for Jadyn, and fled to [[Willow Creek]], where he rented a [[Crespo House|home]] of his own with savings from his part time job and a winning lottery ticket. A fateful meeting with [[Bennett Reardon]] spurred Henry into purchasing the house for himself, and settling fully into life in Willow Creek.

> Henry and Bennett make up.

Henry quickly realized that he was ill equipped to be a home owner. He had no career, no friends, no family, and the jobs he applied didn't want him. When Ellen showed up at his front door, offering to get him high school diploma, Henry was somewhat weirded out, but also grateful, as he was sure Ellen was right and he would need it. While Ellen worked on getting him his diploma through various illicit means, Henry made nice with Bennett and most of his family when he was [[Reardon House|invited over]]. Bennett quickly became one of Henry's closest friends, and he began to question if he liked him as more than just a friend. While in the heat of the moment, Henry kissed Bennett, then immediately regretted it. Luckily for Henry, it didn't lose him Bennett's friendship.

> Henry admits the truth behind going to the gym to Ellen.

When Henry was pressured into attending [[First Church of Our Mother|church]] by Ellen, [[Toby Baxter]] caught his eye. Interested in the man, Henry dragged Ellen along when he followed Toby to the [[Willow Creek Gym]]. Once Ellen realized why they were there, she gave Henry his diploma, and set up an appointment with [[Melody Roach]] for him. At [[Melody's Therapy|the therapist's]], Melody sat Henry down, and told him everything. That Ellen wasn't his friend at all, and in fact wanted her to make it so Henry no longer liked guys. In response, Henry rushed to [[Ellen's House]], revealed that he knew what she'd been up to, and told her that he never wanted to speak to her again.
