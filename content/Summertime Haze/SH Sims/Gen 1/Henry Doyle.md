**Henry Doyle** is the protagonist of the first chapter of [[Summertime Haze]].

## Profile
As an infant, Henry was left on the doorstep of a church that [[Jadyn Yépez]] attended religiously. She ended up taking care of him temporarily as a favor to the church, and with time, she came to care for him as her own son. She purchased a [[Jadyn's House|home]] in [[Newcrest]], and raised Henry there. Henry enjoyed the perfect childhood under her care.

> Henry is outed at school.

As a teenager, Henry's perfect childhood morphed into loneliness. He had a great relationship with Jadyn, but struggled to connect with others at [[Newcrest High|school]].  His closest confidant in high school was [[Ellen Bowers]], the school counselor, and when he finally felt as if he had a friend in [[Tatiana Long]], she outed him to the school when he chose to confide in her. Unwilling to return to that school, Henry packed up his things, left a note for Jadyn, and fled to [[Willow Creek]], where he rented a [[Crespo House|home]] of his own with savings from his part time job and a winning lottery ticket. A fateful meeting with [[Bennett Reardon]] spurred Henry into purchasing the house for himself, and settling fully into life in Willow Creek.

> Henry and Bennett make up.

Henry quickly realized that he was ill equipped to be a home owner. He had no career, no friends, no family, and the jobs he applied didn't want him. When Ellen showed up at his front door, offering to get him high school diploma, Henry was somewhat weirded out, but also grateful, as he was sure Ellen was right and he would need it. While Ellen worked on getting him his diploma through various illicit means, Henry made nice with Bennett and most of his family when he was [[Reardon House|invited over]]. Bennett quickly became one of Henry's closest friends, and he began to question if he liked him as more than just a friend. While in the heat of the moment, Henry kissed Bennett, then immediately regretted it. Luckily for Henry, it didn't lose him Bennett's friendship.

> Henry admits the truth behind going to the gym to Ellen.

When Henry was pressured into attending [[First Church of Our Mother|church]] by Ellen, [[Toby Baxter]] caught his eye. Interested in the man, Henry dragged Ellen along when he followed Toby to the [[Willow Creek Gym]]. Once Ellen realized why they were there, she gave Henry his diploma, and set up an appointment with [[Melody Roach]] for him. At [[Melody's Therapy|the therapist's]], Melody sat Henry down, and told him everything. That Ellen wasn't his friend at all, and in fact wanted her to make it so Henry no longer liked guys. In response, Henry rushed to [[Ellen's House]], revealed that he knew what she'd been up to, and told her that he never wanted to speak to her again.

> Henry rants to Toby and Jordan.

Having officially cut Ellen off, Henry was furious at just how easily he'd been duped. He felt betrayed. Feeling petty, Henry rushed right back to the gym that had kicked off Ellen's betrayal. Once he snuck in, Henry sat down and started to cry, where he was, to his surprise, approached by Toby. Toby let him know that he was married, but recognizing his broken Henry looked, he joined Henry for a drink at the top of the rooftop bar. At that bar, Henry spilled all to Toby and the bartender, [[Jordan Crespo]], and the three of them became fast friends.

> People Against Ellen meets for the first time.

Henry's old bully [[Jaxon Kauker]] came knocking at Henry's door, making his new life feel less safe and cozy. Spurred into action, Henry immediately had a wall put up around his property, which attracted the attention of Bennett. At Bennett's urging, Henry created a group he could rant to about Ellen which included the two of them, Toby, and Jordan. He named them People Against Ellen, or POE for short. Their meetings became a weekly thing and soon tackled each of their problems. With time, Toby's friend [[Paolo Rocca]] and Jordan's friend [[Hope Peck]] joined them, making POE a strong six.

> A POE gathering with everyone in attendance.

Having developed a new closeness with Bennett and Jordan, and with both of them looking to move out of their previous living situations, Henry happily welcomed them into his home. With the three of them living there together, Henry's home finally felt full and safe. They continued to hold weekly POE gatherings and tackle all of the problems facing each member, even occasionally being joined by Toby's wife, [[Hayley Baxter|Hayley]], who became their unofficial seventh.

> Toby kisses Henry.

It was at one of these gatherings when Toby came up with an excuse to get Henry alone upstairs where he could kiss him. Henry's feelings for Toby had never fully faded, but he'd done a good job at burying them- he had no interest in breaking up a family. He told Toby that he would not agree to be with him as long as Hayley was still married to him. The next day, Toby claimed that he had told Hayley everything, and Henry finally gave into his feelings, yet later that week, Hayley collapsed and Toby had to rush her to the hospital. Filled with an immense guilt, Toby completely cut off Henry.

> Bennett and Jordan provide emotional support to Henry.

Henry desperately tried to connect with Toby again but was rebuffed again and again, especially once Hayley's friend [[Reese Inda]] stepped in to help the Baxter family. Bennett and Jordan provided him with emotional support throughout, and made every effort to connect with Toby as well, but he wasn't open to speaking to any of them. At around this time, Jaxon broke into Henry's house. Henry caught him and could have turned him into the police, but after Toby, Henry recognized that there might be something deeper going on with Jaxon, so he let him go.

> Henry returns home and talks with Jadyn.

With Toby seemingly being out of his life forever, Henry decided that he missed his mom. He went to see her again and thanked her for everything. Jadyn was beyond excited to see him again, dispelling years of fears that she'd hold him running away against him. When he came back, Hayley had passed in the hospital. At Jordan and Hope's insistence, he attended Hayley's funeral despite not being invited and exchanged careful words with Toby, telling him that cutting off your friends was the last thing he should be doing.

> Henry admits just how much Toby means to him.

With that ice broken, Henry went by [[Baxter House|Toby's house]] for the first time in ages and actually spoke with him. He gently suggested that having a support network of friends would help Toby, and Toby admitted to Henry that he felt as if what they were doing killed Hayley. He promised he'd think about it and Henry went on his way. As he reflected on Toby's words, Henry finally broke down fully. In a support circle assembled by Jordan, he admitted just how much Toby meant to him and how much it hurt him that he could do nothing to help him.

## Personality
Henry tends to be rather impulsive and overly emotional. His emotions can carry him away, causing him to take quick and decisive action, such as when he ran away from [[Newcrest]], confronted [[Ellen Bowers|Ellen]] for the first time, or stormed off to the [[Willow Creek Gym|gym]] on a whim to spite Ellen. 

Henry loves very deeply. Despite running away from home, he thought about [[Jadyn Yépez|Jadyn]] regularly as he looked back fondly on their time together and felt guilt about abandoning her. He loves both [[Bennett Reardon|Bennett]] and [[Jordan Crespo|Jordan]] tremendously, becoming somewhat dependent on them in his darkest moments. However, nowhere is Henry's capability to love clearer than his relationship with [[Toby Baxter|Toby]]. What started as recklessly recognizing that he was attractive became a full blown crush as he got to know him. Henry, however, recognizing that Toby was married to [[Hayley Baxter|Hayley]] and had kids, buried that crush deep. He preferred for Toby to be happy more than anything else. Toby admitting that he had feelings for Henry too sent Henry on a deep spiral, and in the months that followed, he realized that he'd never stop loving Toby. He simply meant too much to him.
