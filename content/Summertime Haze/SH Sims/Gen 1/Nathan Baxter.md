> Toby greets Nathan upon returning home.

As a child, Nathan had any kid's dream life. He grew up in a [[Baxter House|well-maintained home]], was looked after by his stay-at-home mom, [[Hayley Baxter|Hayley]], and his father, [[Toby Baxter|Toby]], worked hard to support the family. The four of them became a beloved and well respected family at [[First Church of Our Mother|church]]. Any conflict was minor, typically reserved to small squabbles between Nathan and his older sister, [[Jennifer Baxter|Jennifer]]. Nathan found the whole 'perfect family' image they kept up to be somewhat exhausting, but he enjoyed the benefits.

Nathan's childhood came crashing down around him when he and Jennifer walked in on Hayley collapsed on the floor. She was rushed to the hospital and Toby fell into a deep depression, leaving Nathan and Jennifer to their own devices. Eventually, Hayley's friend [[Reese Inda]] stepped in and got things in order again. It wasn't enough, unfortunately, as the bad times weren't over yet; it came out that Toby had cheated on Hayley with [[Henry Doyle]] and Hayley passed away in the hospital not long after. Before Nathan knew it, he was attending his mother's funeral.

As Nathan's world came crashing down around him, he was filled with a deep regret that eventually festered into anger. He'd failed to appreciate what he'd had, and he'd lost it all way too early all because of this Henry.

## Personality
Nathan is defined by his lack of patience. He wants to do things at his own speed and gets irritated when his plans are thrown awry, something which regularly puts him in conflict with [[Jennifer Baxter|Jennifer]], who really knows how to put her foot down.

After [[Hayley Baxter|Hayley]]'s passing, a deep rage began to burn deep within Nathan. He felt as if his life was fundamentally unfair, a feeling which was only aided by his failure to appreciate what he'd had with his family while he had it.
