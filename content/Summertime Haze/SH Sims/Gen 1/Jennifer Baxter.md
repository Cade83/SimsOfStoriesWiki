## Profile

> Toby greets Jennifer and Nathan upon returning home.

As a child, Jennifer had the perfect life. She grew up in a [[Baxter House|well-maintained home]], looked after by her stay-at-home mom, [[Hayley Baxter|Hayley]]. Her father, [[Toby Baxter|Toby]], worked hard for the family and the four of them became a beloved and well respected family at [[First Church of Our Mother|church]]. Any conflict was minor, and typically was reserved to small squabbles between Jennifer and her younger brother, [[Nathan Baxter|Nathan]]. She loved her family, her life, and everything about her childhood.

Jennifer's picturesque childhood came crashing down around her when Nathan and her walked in on Hayley collapsed on the floor. She was rushed to the hospital and Toby fell into a deep depression, leaving Jennifer and Nathan to their own devices. Eventually, Hayley's friend [[Reese Inda]] stepped in and got things in order again. It wasn't enough, unfortunately, as the bad times weren't over yet; it came out that Toby had cheated on Hayley with [[Henry Doyle]] and Hayley passed away in the hospital not long after. Before Jennifer knew it, she was attending her mother's funeral.

As Jennifer pieced together what Toby had done to her mother, she began to resent him. Yet, she was stuck with him. He was her legal guardian.

## Personality
Jennifer has a tendency to be a bit of a stick-in-the-mud. She speaks logically and firmly and is more than willing to interrupt others to get a point across. It's an attitude that puts Jennifer in regular conflict with [[Nathan Baxter|Nathan]], who's more free-spirited.

When it comes to love, however, Jennifer softens. She adored the stories [[Hayley Baxter|Hayley]] told about her and [[Toby Baxter|Toby]]'s love story, which only aided her great love for both of her parents. Toby cheating on Hayley came as a great betrayal that shook Jennifer's entire world view to its core.
