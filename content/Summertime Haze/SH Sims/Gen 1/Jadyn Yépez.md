**Jadyn Yépez** is a character in the first chapter of [[Summertime Haze]]. She's the adoptive mother of [[Henry Doyle]].

## Profile
Jadyn and her brother [[José Yépez|José]] had a quiet, conservative childhood where they were taught to be kind to others and to stick firmly to their own moral boundaries. Those were peaceful years for the two of them, where Jadyn would do her artwork to the sound of José strumming his guitar.

As they grew older, Jadyn and José drifted apart, and Jadyn chose to pursue art. While she enjoyed what she did, she was lonely. She tried to dedicate herself more fully to religion at first, even considering becoming a nun at one point, but one fateful day, when a [[Henry Doyle|baby boy]] was left on the doorstep of her local church, she settled on adopting. She bought a [[Jadyn's House|house]] in [[Newcrest]] to raise the boy in, then signed the paperwork and became the legal guardian of Henry Doyle.

The two enjoyed some wonderful years together, with Jadyn giving Henry a picturesque childhood. She came to greatly value her relationship with her son, and Henry did in turn. She was left devastated when Henry ran away from home without even a word to her, and tried her best to find him, even meeting with his school counselor, [[Ellen Bowers]], in the hope that she'd have some information for her. In her search, Jadyn eventually received some answers as to why Henry had run from his classmate, [[Tatiana Long]], and she came to understand why he'd run away.

Years passed without a word from Henry, and Jadyn eventually gave up on ever hearing from him again. However, a day finally came when Henry decided to visit home, and Jadyn was sure to express that her love for him was unconditional, and how much she'd missed him. The two chatted for hours. While Jadyn and Henry's lives diverged from that moment onward she continued to support him from afar.

> Jadyn and José talk to Zoe.

With her concerns about Henry lifted from her shoulders, Jadyn returned to her previous cheerful self. She went about the remainder of her life helping others, and even recommended adopting to [[Zoe Presley]], a friend of her brother's, when she brought up concerns about never getting married. Despite the challenging years in the middle, Jadyn was proud of how Henry had turned out, and she would do it all again in a heartbeat.

#### Legacy
Henry valued his relationship with Jadyn greatly, even going as far as to call it one of the most important things in his life. Many of his early decisions upon his move to [[Willow Creek]] were made with the hope that Jadyn would one day be impressed by the man he'd become. He named his graphic design business, JH Studio, after her; it being a portmanteau of Jadyn and Henry.

## Personality
Similarly to her brother, [[José Yépez|José]], Jadyn values peace and honesty. A very religious woman, she believes in the inherent good intentions of others, and will always give a stranger the benefit of the doubt. Both Jadyn and her brother were raised in a way that rewarded helping others, and Jadyn continued to help and advise others throughout her life.

What defines Jadyn's personal relationships is her love for her son, [[Henry Doyle|Henry]]. As she raised him, he became her most trusted confidant, and the person she cared most about in the world. Henry leaving without speaking to her first wounded her deeply, but as she learned more about him, she came to understand why. When he returned home, Jadyn was able to go right back to where they'd left off, as nothing will ever shake the love she has for her son.
