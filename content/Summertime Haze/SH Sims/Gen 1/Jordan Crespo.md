## Profile

> Jordan chats with Hope in their dorm.

As someone with a great passion for cooking, Jordan went to culinary school straight out of high school. Once there, she moved into [[Jordan’s Dorm|the dorms]], where she met her randomly assigned roommate [[Hope Peck]] for the first time. The two of them were fast friends at first, but once school started to get serious they became rivals. Things became so ugly between the two of them that it became something they were both asked about years later in the professional careers. Regardless, during this time, Jordan and Hope had a brief romantic fling, but neither of them enjoyed it.

> Jordan meets Henry and Toby at the bar at the gym.

In school, Hope focused on building professional relationships, while Jordan focused on grades. This meant that Hope enjoyed success, while Jordan struggled in her shadow. The two of them continued to live together and managed to set their rivalry aside, but Jordan couldn't help but feel inferior to Hope. While she was hired for grant catering jobs, she was stuck as a seasonal bartender at the [[Willow Creek Gym]], and any nicer jobs came about thanks to Hope taking pity on her. Regardless, it was while working this job at the gym that Jordan met [[Henry Doyle]] and [[Toby Baxter]] for the first time. Henry had recently suffered a betrayal from [[Ellen Bowers]], and Jordan's sympathy for him and criticism of Toby endeared her to Henry, and they exchanged numbers and started texting regularly.
