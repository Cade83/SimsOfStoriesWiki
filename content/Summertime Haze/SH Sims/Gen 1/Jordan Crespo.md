## Profile

> Jordan chats with Hope in their dorm.

As someone with a great passion for cooking, Jordan went to culinary school straight out of high school. Once there, she moved into [[Jordan’s Dorm|the dorms]], where she met her randomly assigned roommate [[Hope Peck]] for the first time. The two of them were fast friends at first, but once school started to get serious they became rivals. Things became so ugly between the two of them that it became something they were both asked about years later in the professional careers. Regardless, during this time, Jordan and Hope had a brief romantic fling, but neither of them enjoyed it.

In school, Hope focused on building professional relationships, while Jordan focused on grades. This meant that Hope enjoyed success, while Jordan struggled in her shadow. The two of them continued to live together and managed to set their rivalry aside, but Jordan couldn't help but feel inferior to Hope. While she was hired for grant catering jobs, she was stuck as a seasonal bartender at the [[Willow Creek Gym]], and any nicer jobs came about thanks to Hope taking pity on her. Regardless, it was while working this job at the gym that Jordan met [[Henry Doyle]] and [[Toby Baxter]] for the first time. Henry had recently suffered a betrayal from [[Ellen Bowers]], and Jordan's sympathy for him and criticism of Toby endeared her to Henry, and they exchanged numbers and started texting regularly.

> Jordan arrives at [[Crespo House|Henry's house]] for the gathering.

Jordan was included in Henry's inaugural 'People Against Ellen' meeting alongside Toby and Henry's friend [[Bennett Reardon]]. After that first meeting, they began to meet weekly, all discussing and tackling each of their problems. Jordan brought up her long standing issues with Hope and her career and at Bennett and Henry's suggestion, she agreed to invite Hope to a meeting so everyone else could pick her brain and see if she'd be willing to make Jordan a full-time employee or partner of hers. After some pushing from Bennett at a gathering, Hope admitted that she was looking to hire some permanent help.

> Jordan and Bennett are asked about their relationship again.

As Jordan spent more time with Henry, Bennett, and Toby, she started to catch feelings for Bennett. He stuck up for her, he tried to resolve her problems, and she loved how bold his sense of style was. Her attraction to Bennett was something Hope took immediate note of as her longterm roommate, so she began to try anything she could to get Jordan and Bennett together. Once Jordan moved in with Bennett and Henry, her efforts only intensified. However, unknown to Hope was the fact that Jordan and Bennett had already begun seeing each other in secret, both fed up with others pressuring them. They refused to give Hope and Henry the satisfaction. They finally gave in and admitted it when everyone went out for a meal together.

> Jordan organizes her 'circle of truth'.

Once fully moved in and established in Henry's home, Jordan became the voice of action. If anyone questioned themselves or hesitated, she would encourage them to go for it. Jordan pushed hard for Henry, Bennett, Hope, and herself to crash [[Hayley Baxter]]'s funeral, insisting that they'd been unjustly excluded. At the same time, she's also a sympathetic voice, dropping everything whenever Henry or Bennett are going through something personal. When Henry was having a tough time with Toby, she had everyone sit in a circle and talk about their feelings, even opening up herself about her continued career struggles.

## Personality
Jordan is a very loud and boisterous woman. She proudly says exactly what she wants to say at any time, even going as far as reprimanding [[Toby Baxter|Toby]] for his limited views during her first real conversation with him. Jordan refuses to be pushed around, which is one of the main reasons why she kept the early days of her relationship with [[Bennett Reardon|Bennett]] a secret. Her confidence carries over to her actions as well, with her always being the one to lead the charge, as what happened when [[Hayley Baxter|Hayley]] ended up in the hospital and her eventual funeral and she led [[Henry Doyle|Henry]] and Bennett right in despite their lack of an invitation.

Despite Jordan's seemingly endless confidence, she does, however, suffer from an inferiority complex when it comes to her work. Her furious competition with [[Hope Peck|Hope]] in college led to her feeling as if she was still in competition with her even as an adult, and it was undeniable that Hope was doing better than her. Hope and everyone around Jordan insist that she is a fantastic chef, but she struggles to believe it herself due to her lack of professional success.
