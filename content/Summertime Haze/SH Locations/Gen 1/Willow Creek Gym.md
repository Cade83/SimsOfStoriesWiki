**Willow Creek Gym** is a location in [[Summertime Haze]]. It's an upper end gym located in downtown [[Willow Creek]].

## Profile
The Willow Creek Gym is located in the hills of [[Willow Creek]], a wealthier part of town. It's set up in a renovated historic building, although much of the building's previous charm was stripped out in the pursuit of modern aesthetics. The gym has top of the line gym equipment, and even offers a rooftop bar, although few take advantage of it.

In the [[First Generation]], [[Toby Baxter]] and [[Paolo Rocca]] were employed here as personal trainers, and [[Jordan Crespo]] was on contract as a bartender.
