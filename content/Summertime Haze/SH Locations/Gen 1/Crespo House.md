The **Crespo House** is a location in [[Summertime Haze]]. It's the home [[Henry Doyle]] purchases upon his move to [[Willow Creek]], and he's soon joined by [[Bennett Reardon]] and [[Jordan Crespo]]. 

## Profile
Before [[Henry Doyle]] purchased the house, it was owned by an old woman. She passed away when she slipped on spilled orange juice and fell, and was found a week later by [[Alina Reardon]]. Due to her passing, [[Adrienne Brooks]] was able to secure cheap rent for Henry, although she didn't disclose that fact that it was due to the previous owner's passing to him.

When Henry moved in, all of the original furniture came with it. After hearing from [[Bennett Reardon]] that it was an 'old lady furniture', Henry impulsively got rid of it through [[Sergio Esparza]], who was willing to do a furniture trade with him.
