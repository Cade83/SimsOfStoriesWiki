The **Reardon House** is a location in [[Summertime Haze]]. It is the home of [[Alina Reardon|Alina]] and [[Layne Reardon]], and was where they raised their children [[Bennett Reardon|Bennett]] and [[Regan Reardon|Regan]].

## Profile
Alina and Layne purchased a plot of land in [[Willow Creek]] when they were still newly married, and gradually built up their house as needs arose. Bedrooms were added for each of their children when they were born, a patio was put in when they wanted outdoor space, a storage room became an attic when Layne took up gardening... As a result, the house saw numerous odd additions, and became somewhat of an eyesore for a neighborhood, likely lowering the price of [[Henry Doyle]]'s [[Crespo House|house]], which was across the street, at the time he bought it.

It was well known in the area that both Alina and Layne were semi-retired members of the police, so they kept the house secured with needless security measures, as their reputations alone kept the neighborhood relatively crime free.
