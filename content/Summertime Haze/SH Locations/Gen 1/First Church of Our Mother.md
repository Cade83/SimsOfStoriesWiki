The **First Church of Our Mother** is the primary church of [[Willow Creek]].

## Profile
The First Church has sat in the hills of [[Willow Creek]], backed by the [[First Church Cemetery]], for many centuries. It's said to be the first church built to honor the [[Charise|Goddess]], a claim that has resulted in discourse that has been around nearly as long as the church itself. The First Church focuses its teachings on self reflection and the sanctity of the natural world, illustrated by the heavy presence of mirrors inside and the somewhat natural grounds.

In the [[First Generation]], [[Toby Baxter|Toby]] and [[Hayley Baxter]] are frequent attendees of mornings sermons, and are later joined by [[Ellen Bowers]] upon her move to Willow Creek. All three of them regularly visit the church on their own time to seek answers and do their self reflections. After Hayley's passing, Toby has her funeral at the church.
