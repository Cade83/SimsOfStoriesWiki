The **Baxter House** is a location in [[Summertime Haze]]. It's the home of [[Toby Baxter|Toby]] and [[Hayley Baxter]].

## Profile
[[Toby Baxter|Toby]] and [[Hayley Baxter]] purchased their forever home upon their move to [[Willow Creek]], excited to raise their future children and grow old together within it. Hayley did the majority of the interior decoration, as she was the individual who spent the most time at home as a stay at home mother. Toby, Hayley, and their two children [[Jennifer Baxter|Jennifer]] and [[Nathan Baxter|Nathan]] spent some wonderful years together here, all of which was cut short by Hayley's heart attack and subsequent passing.

As a single father, Toby asked close family friend [[Reese Inda]] to help out with his children and the home while he investigated his wife's death.
