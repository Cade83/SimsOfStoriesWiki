Welcome to the wiki for [The Sims of Stories](https://thesimsofstories.weebly.com)!

This wiki contains pages that detailing every last character and location from all seven stories. I originally created this for myself, but I felt as if others could appreciate it as well, so here it is.

To start, here's all seven stories:
* **[[Just Starting Out]]** - *After being forced out of their childhood home by their parents, John and Kayla scramble to build a new life for themselves in Newcrest.*
* **[[Dreams of Fame]]** - *When Giovanna first met Zoe, she had no idea what she was about to get into. Zoe, who'd always dreamed of being a famous author, will do anything to achieve her goals.*
* **[[Summertime Haze]]** - *Henry's running from his past mistakes. But when people from his past start to reappear in his life, Henry's new perfect dream of life enters a downward spiral.*
* **[[Courage & Resolve]]** - *A single mother in a new neighborhood, Amelia works hard to provide for her two children. She has to try her best to keep everything together when an unsavory character from her past resurfaces.*
* **[[Mai Legacy]]** - *When James Mai left home to escape the future his parents wanted for him, he had no idea what he'd end up facing. From a bitter spouse, to a rival family, he faces many trials.*
* **[[Lies and Deceit]]** - *With money running out and four adult children to take care of, life isn't looking good for Tom and Judith-Noelle Gruber. Secrets and dishonestly fill their small apartment. WhenÂ presented with a golden opportunity to start over, the Gruber family takes a chance.* 
* **[[Reborn from the Ash]]** - *Kiara Sanchez lives the perfect life- she lives in the mansion of her incredibly wealthy parents, Antonio and Jacqueline, is waited on hand and foot by a multitude of servants, and anything she desires is given to her. But she isn't happy.*
