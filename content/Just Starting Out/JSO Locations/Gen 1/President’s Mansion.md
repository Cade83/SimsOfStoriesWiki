The **President’s Mansion** is the historical home for [[President|presidents]], located in [[Willow Creek]]. It appears in [[Dreams of Fame]].

## Profile
Prior to [[Mitch Laurent]], each [[President|president]] made the President’s Mansion their home. It was built for the president when the world had settled on electing one leader to lead them, and historical precedent required that all presidents make this building their home throughout their time in power.

President Laurent, however, found the President’s Mansion to be a rather unappealing place to live, more suited to work than leisure. After the initial allure of living in the building wore off, he left [[Willow Creek]] on a private jet and began to purchase homes that suited his tastes elsewhere in the world. His actions took the President’s Mansion from the home of all presidents to President Laurent's Willow Creek office. He sat an example that every president after him followed, and the President’s Mansion was never the sole residence for a president again.
