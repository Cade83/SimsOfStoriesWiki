## Profile

> Melody leads a yoga session in her studio.

While Melody Roach always had dreams of having her own therapy practice, having even studied for it in college, life led her down a different path, and she ended up hosting yoga sessions at [[Ms. Roach’s Yoga]], a space she owned and operated herself. It was at one of those sessions where Melody first encountered [[Kayla Brooks]]. The two were fast friends, and Melody began regularly attending Kayla's house parties and supporting her book launches.

Kayla shouted Melody out in the first *Living on Less* book she published, and when her books began to take off, attendance at Melody's yoga studio began to go up, and she began to see more of an income. When Kayla walked into her studio worried about her brother [[John Brooks|John]] one morning, something clicked for Melody, and she offered her services as a therapist to her. After the session, Kayla encouraged Melody to start her own practice.

> Melody performs hypnosis on Zoe.

Melody took Kayla's advice, and bid her friends in [[Newcrest]] goodbye, and moved to [[Willow Creek]], where she then opened [[Melody's Therapy]], her practice. She proved to be rather good at what she did, and as her renown in Willow Creek grew, so did her prices. She eventually attracted the attention of [[Summer Holiday]], who demanded that she perform hypnotherapy on her the famous author [[Zoe Presley]], as she lived with her and found her insufferable. Melody was excited to meet Zoe, but was hesitant to do what she asked until she saw the large sum of money Summer was offering. She did extensive research, and even met with the [[Elaine Oldham|swamp witch]] to master the skill. After Melody did as Summer had asked, she felt as if she was successful enough to list hypnotherapy as a speciality on her website and pamphlets.

> Melody meets with Henry.

Her work wasn't completely masterful, however, and Zoe would regularly revert back to her old self, which was something Summer hounded Melody about. Melody was secretly glad, as she'd come to regret what she did to Zoe, and was glad to know that her original personality still remained. This regret later saved [[Henry Doyle]], as she refused to perform the same procedure on him for [[Ellen Bowers]]. She instead chose to warn him. While it took a while for her to remove hypnotherapy as a speciality from her website and pamphlets, Melody dedicated the rest of her life to being a good therapist, instead of one focused on profit and income. 

## Personality
A very serious woman dedicated to living her life with the utmost peace and tranquility, Melody has a levelheaded view of the world. She's all too happy to share that peace of mind with others, which she does through yoga, therapy, and speaking plainly to others. She has no fear of being very direct in her words to others, and will gladly tell others off for swearing needlessly or making bad decisions.

Melody has one fatal flaw, however. Her love of money. As someone who never had enough of it in the past, and was therefore unable to achieve her dreams, she came to enjoy the new sense of security that having money gave her. Melody can compromise her own morals for a large enough sum of money, yet, after the [[Zoe Presley|Zoe]] situation, she was self-aware enough to realize that this was wrong, and redevoted herself to helping others.
