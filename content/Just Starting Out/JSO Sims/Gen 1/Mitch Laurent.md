> [!quote|author] Mitch to Cassandra
> “Quite frankly, Cas? I’m bored. I’m bored of this career. I thought this job would be a lot more fun than it ended up being when I ran. And I tried, for a bit. But, being a public servant? It’s not all it’s trumped up to be.”

**Mitch Laurent** is a character introduced in the first chapter of [[Just Starting Out]]. He's the [[President|president]] for the entirety of the [[First Generation]].

## Profile
When Mitch first became [[President|president]], he had good intentions, even if he'd taken some dark roads to get there. He'd won the election through a combination of blackmail of the other candidates and his roguish charm. As president, he felt as if he could do some real good for the world, but the thanklessness of the job and the tedium of bureaucracy began to wear on him.

>  Mitch and Xayri.

The most thrilling moment of his presidential career is something Mitch can't even remember. [[Beatrice Stark|Xayri]] visited as an ambassador from the neighboring planet of [[Sixam]], and as the two spent time with each other, they fell for each other. This relationship was short-lived, however, as once the Sixamese queen [[Xanthippe]] found out about their romantic relationship, Mitch's memory was scrubbed, and Xayri became a fugitive. Regardless of his missing memory, a part of Mitch seemingly never moved on, as his computer password stayed X A Y R I for the entirety of his political career.

Mitch was too prideful to step down from the role too early and allow another election to take place, however, so he chose to adjust the goals of his administration to more directly benefit himself personally. He began to invest government funds in both external companies and companies he founded personally, claiming he was turning the government into a business that could turn a profit, which would then all be reinvested in the people. In reality, Mitch had set himself up as an executive of each of these companies, under various assumed names and identities, of course, and received a small chunk of all of their profits, which he then funneled directly into his own personal bank account. Only then did Mitch finally feel as if he was receiving adequate thanks for all the work he did.

Now fabulously wealthy, Mitch began to jet across the world, and he spent more time at parties and various political gatherings than in his offices in [[Willow Creek]] and [[Windenburg]]. He'd sign any deal that was lucrative to him personally. Whenever anyone got too close to discovering his secrets, Mitch would pay them off, all of which never made even the slightest dent in his bank account. Regardless, the idea that Mitch was somehow profiting off of everything he was doing became a very open secret, even if no one could prove it. Public opinion of him dropped further and further, but he still refused to resign.

>  Mitch encounters Cassandra in his hidden room.

Despite all of his illicit dealings, Mitch still found the presidency to be tedious and, frankly, boring. He began to hire other people to do his job for him so he could spend even more time traveling, the most notable of which being [[Cassandra Goth]]. Her [[Bella Goth|pare]][[Mortimer Goth|nts]] personally benefited from his administration, but Cassandra was determined to work for him for long enough to turn up evidence that would end his political career, which would clear the way for her ascension. It took many years, but thanks to the illegal dealings of [[Travis Scott]], Cassandra discovered one of Mitch's secret accounts. She broke into his [[Laurent Windenburg Mansion|office in Windenburg]], and discovered a secret room that contained records of each of his illegal dealings. Mitch surprised Cassandra in the room, and personally helped her uncover his dirty laundry before telling her he was stepping down as president. When asked why, Mitch claimed that he was testing what she was capable of, but more so for his own enjoyment than Cassandra's benefit.

> Mitch attends the Beauchamp's campaign party.

After his conversation with Cassandra, Mitch went straight to work, determined to create a presidential candidate who would keep up his policies and ideals, and most importantly, wouldn't stop the government from using the businesses he was making money from. He settled on [[Felix Beauchamp]] as his solution. Felix was smart, understood law, profit and how to [[Beauchamp Law|grow a business]], and he was more interested in making the law more approachable than reversing any of Mitch's policies. He reminded Mitch of himself when he'd first run for president.

What Mitch didn't know, however, was that Felix was completely incapable at giving public speeches, and Felix was knocked out in the semifinals of the Presidential Debates. He kicked himself for not doing research beyond Felix's achievements and politics.

## Personality
Mitch is a man defined by his own self-interest. Everything he does is for the benefit of himself, from testing [[Cassandra Goth|Cassandra]], to his business dealings, even going all the way back to his initial campaign for the [[President|presidency]]. Mitch has a never ending desire for monetary gain and entertainment, and too much stagnation results in him becoming bored. Being bored is something Mitch dislikes more than anything else, and he will plan any number of destructive or otherwise illegal things to remedy it.

Socially, Mitch creates an air of being disinterested and casual. He'll give others nicknames they hate, talk informally, and generally act completely immature for someone in his position. In an argument, he dances around his opponent through a collection of lies and brutal honesty that undermine his opponents points, resulting in them feeling inferior and if they have lost. All of this masks a Mitch that can get very serious, and has endless machinations going on in his mind just beneath the surface.
