The **Mai Cemetery** is a location introduced in the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. It's the private resting place for members of the Mai Family and contains records of their legacy.

## Profile
Knowing that all of the biggest families in society had their own private cemeteries, [[James Mai]] purchased a plot of land near his [[Mai House|house]] to build a final resting place for his own family. It contains several open plots of land, as well as a small mausoleum. The mausoleum has a trap door in the floor that leads into a lengthy hallway designed to celebrate all of the Legacy heirs and spouses, which James named 'Legacy Hall'. The Mai Legacy armor is located at the end of the hidden hall.

James unveiled the cemetery to his family for the first time to hold a memorial for his parents, [[Daniela Mai|Daniela]] and [[Ed Mai|Ed]]. His funeral was held not long after, and at that event, [[Leah Mai|Leah]] was crowned as Legacy Heiress. [[Susan Harper]] revealed Legacy Hall to her- it's meant to be a secret only beheld by legacy heirs and their spouses.
