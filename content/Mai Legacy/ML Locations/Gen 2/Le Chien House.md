The **Le Chien House** is a location introduced in the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. It's the home of the Le Chien Family.

## Profile
The Le Chien House was built centuries ago by the very first Le Chiens to establish their legacy family. Since then, the house has seen a plethora of renovations, but it's always sat on the same ancestral land that has been passed down for generations.

During [[Rosaline Le Chien|Rosaline]]'s time as heiress, the house took on a more modern appearance, as Rosaline wanted to prioritize what was trendy and in. It was all part of her effort to make herself more relatable to the people, as she felt living in a stuffy mansion would go against all the good will she generated from her marriage to [[Bronson Le Chien|Bronson]].

When Rosaline's successor, [[Joaquin Le Chien|Joaquin]], took over, he had no intention of changing the look of the house. He liked the angle his mom had taken with the place, but his wife, [[Hajar Cresques]], had a different idea. She wanted something that felt much older, something that was vaguely intimidating and represented the might of a legacy family. Despite Rosaline's protests, Hajar overhauled the house to suit her tastes with little argument from Joaquin, who'd been bewitched by her.
