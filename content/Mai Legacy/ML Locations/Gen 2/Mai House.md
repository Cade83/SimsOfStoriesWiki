The **Mai House** is a location in the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. It's the home of the Mai Legacy, constructed by [[James Mai]].

## Profile
When [[James Mai]] ran away from [[Daniela and Ed's|home]], he purchased an empty plot of land on an island off the coast of [[Windenburg]] and tried his best to make ends meet through paintings, foraging, and showering at the [[Harbor Quarter Gym|local gym]]. With time, he was eventually able to get a one room shack constructed that had a bed and a kitchen in it.

Regardless, his house was still an eyesore, so [[Joaquin Le Chien]] recommended that James try karaoke for some additional cash, and sure enough, James came back with substantial winnings that allowed him to further expand. That same night, James met his future wife, [[Susan Harper]]. With their combined incomes, they were able to transform his shack into something that resembled a home.

It took a bit more time, but with renovations, the house became a source of pride for the Mai family, infused with both James and Susan's personal touch and shared history, from James's paintings, to an indoor basketball court for Susan, and even the installation of the karaoke machine from the night they first met.
