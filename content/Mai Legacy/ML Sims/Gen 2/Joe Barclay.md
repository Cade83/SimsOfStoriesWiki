## Profile

> Aarohi introduces Joe to her friends.

Joe first met [[Aarohi Barclay]] when she was desperate to find someone to marry. All of her friends were married, with children, and aging, and she was lucky to meet Joe, who was very much in the same boat. Joe and Aarohi got married within a week of meeting each other, with Joe agreeing to take Aarohi's last name, and soon enough, Aarohi was pregnant with [[Teala Barclay|Teala]]. While Aarohi had texted her friends about Joe, Joe only introduced himself to everyone once Aarohi was already two months pregnant.

> Joe and Aarohi attend James's funeral.

As Aarohi drifted apart from her friends as they aged, Joe remained her rock. He was the one person she could confide in, and was someone she could speak to at any formal event she ended up attending as her older friends began to pass away. Joe and Aarohi raised Teala quietly, without much help from or connection with the Mai family Aarohi had once counted on so much.

## Personality
While Joe is a man of few words, he has a jealous streak running a mile wide. Early on in his relationship with [[Aarohi Barclay|Aarohi]], he was suspicious of her friendship with [[Lily Feng]], as well as her close friendship with most others. Her drifting apart from her friends came as a relief to him, as it let the two of them focus on raising [[Teala Barclay|Teala]]. He'd also never cared for most of Aarohi's friends.
