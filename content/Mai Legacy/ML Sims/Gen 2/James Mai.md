## Profile

> James waits at the [[Oasis Springs Bustop|bus stop]].

James grew up in [[Oasis Springs]] as the only son of [[Daniela Mai|Daniela]] and [[Ed Mai]]. Daniela, a retired politician, operated a local resort, and Ed was a painter. James, an aspiring painter himself, was subject to the constant reiteration of both of his parent's high expectations for him, with Daniela wanting him to help out with operation of the resort and become fabulously wealthy, and Ed pushing James to become an even greater success than he was. James wanted none of it. He wanted to enjoy his life, not dedicate it to work and the never ending pursuit of his success. Eventually, James snapped, changed his phone number, and ran away.

> James sings his heart out at karaoke night.

James found his way to [[Windenburg]], purchased a cheap plot of land that was rather undesirable due to existing in the shadows of the giants of Windenburg, then dedicated himself to establishing a legacy that could rival the expectations of his parents. The first month was rough, with James living in a glorified shack, existing entirely off of what he could forage, plant, and grow, and showering at a gym across the bay. Regardless, he was happy, which led to him singing as he tended his garden. His neighbor [[Joaquin Le Chien]] overheard him singing one fateful afternoon, and recommended he give karaoke night at [[Planet Honeypop]] a try for some extra cash. James ended up winning the prize money at karaoke night, and attracted the attention of [[Susan Harper]], who he exchanged contact info with.

> James spends a day with Susan.

James used the money he won at karaoke night to start to get himself on track financially, when once he felt slightly more stable and less anxious about things, he called up Susan. The two of them met up in [[San Myshuno]], where she introduced him to her friend and neighbor [[Akira Kibo]], who hit it off with James quickly. After breaking off from Akira, James and Susan spent the rest of the day together, which ended in James boldly asking Susan out. She refused.

While out with Susan, James encountered [[Victor Feng]], who told him about legacy families, and offered to secure him the armor needed to start one of his own. To distract himself from Susan, James focused on beginning this so-called legacy, and also spent time out with Akira and his friend [[Salim Benali]], both of whom became good friends of his. Months later, Akira invited both James and Susan to Geekcon separately, hoping a 'chance' encounter would encourage two of his greatest friends to reconcile. He was in luck, as James apologized, and Susan felt that she had overreacted.

> James argues with Jacuqes, and Akira has to step in.

As James's friendship with Akira grew, he attracted the attention of [[Jacques Villareal]], Akira's husband. Jacques felt a growing sense of jealousy when it came to James's closeness to Akira, and James did himself no favors by standing up to Jacques in an argument. Swearing vengeance on James, Jacques cooked up a plot to break into James's house and steal his legacy armor, but his failure to account for James's floor plan led to Jacques ending up trapped in James's house and facing a very public arrest. James threw a house party he had been planning on throwing later the same day to prove that he was unshaken, and befriended two of Susan's friends- [[Penny Pizzazz]] and [[Eliza Pancakes]].

> James and Susan get married at the Romance Festival. 

James and Susan got closer and closer as time passed, but they'd both sworn off anything romantic between them. Regardless, they'd chosen to go to the Romance Festival, telling themselves it was to make fun of couples, but both had other intentions deep down. The two of them admitted their feelings to each other, then, feeling spontaneous, they chose to get married on the spot. They were able to shock their friends with the news when they met them at the [[Windenburg Ruins|ruins]] later that same night. James invited Joaquin to that ruins party to thank him for the karaoke night tip that changed his entire life, but when he told Joaquin he was starting a legacy family, things got ugly, as him doing so would threaten the Le Chien Legacy.

> Hajar confronts James and Susan.

Not long after the Romance Festival, Susan moved in with James, and they gave birth to [[Seth Mai|Seth]], who was soon followed by [[Leah Mai|Leah]]. Life had begun to click into place for the two of them- James was starting to actually attract attention as a legacy family contender due to his artwork, which was now being displayed at the [[Casbah Gallery]] due to [[Ulrike Faust]], a friend he'd met at the ruins, and Susan was bringing in money as well as a star basketball player. Their [[Mai House|house]] was actually beginning to look like a home, and that was when the Le Chien family finally felt threatened enough to make a move. [[Hajar Cresques|Hajar]], the wife of Joaquin, entered their home, snapped a photo of their legacy armor, then led them to the [[Le Chien House]], where Joaquin's parents [[Rosaline Le Chien|Rosaline]] and [[Bronson Le Chien|Bronson]] served the Mai family with a lawsuit.

> James speaks in court. 

The Le Chien family required James and Susan to fly out to the [[Goth Brooks Courthouse]], where, despite their best efforts, [[Ethan Marshal|Judge Marshal]] ruled in favor of the Mais, stating that there was no precedent stating that two legacy families couldn't coexist. While James and Susan celebrated, and family friend [[Aarohi Barclay]] watched Seth and Leah, Hajar led Joaquin in a devious scheme to get revenge on the Mai family by aging up their newborn kids, saying that she was taking history for history. The following morning, the Le Chien's legacy armor was gone, and they all wound up back in court, where Judge Marshal again ruled in favor of the Mai family, as there was nothing implicating them in the armor's disappearance.

As parents, James and Susan took a somewhat hands-off approach, both wanting their children to grow into their own people. They of course educated the two of them on what a legacy family was, their history with the Le Chiens, and what inheriting the legacy meant, but beyond that, they let the two of them develop their own opinions, but they weren't afraid to reprimand them if it was needed. Getting used to children who were so much older than they should have been also resulted in a bit of an adjustment period, but they loved them all the same. As they watched Seth and Leah grow up, develop into their own people, and eventually get married, James knew that he'd achieved his goal. He finally had a legacy his parents could be proud of.

> James tells Susan that he needs to return home. 

As James continued to age, he made sure to maintain each of the friendships that had been so important to him earlier in his life. As one of the oldest in his friend group, however, he didn't have to attend too many memorial services, but he recognized that his friends were getting older. Nothing was more of a wakeup call then when Joaquin set fire to Susan's garden, and once again, James, Susan, Joaquin, and Hajar ended up in court. Hajar was in terrible health, and Joaquin didn't look much better. When leaving court, James told Susan that he had to go and visit his parents and find out how they fared after he left. He knew they were significantly older than him, and likely weren't around any longer, but he still wanted to at least know he'd tried.

> James meets Jamie for the first time.

After doing some asking around Oasis Springs, James was directed towards [[Cleary Ranch]], and was shocked when the door was opened by a sister he never knew about- [[Jamie Mai|Jamie]]. Jamie had no fondness for James, and she wasn't afraid to let him know it. She let him know that in his absence, she was the one who took over the resort, she was the one who took care of their parents into their poor health, and that even though Daniela and Ed had read about him in the papers and wished to reach out to him near the end of their lives, she'd shut it down, as she felt James wasn't deserving. Just before James left, he was stopped by Jamie's daughter, [[Colette Cleary|Colette]], who begged him to take her with him. James refused, warning her not to make the same mistake he did, but he did leave her with his number.

> James passes away surrounded by family. 

Upon his return to Windenburg, James officially opened the [[Mai Cemetery]], a project he'd been working on privately with Susan for some time, and he christened it by having a memorial service for Daniela and Ed where he officially introduced them to the rest of his family. Almost as if it had been the last thing he needed to accomplish in life, James passed away from old age not long after, surrounded by his family and the legacy he'd managed to establish. He knew that he'd far surpassed even his parent's lofty expectations for him.

#### Legacy
> [!caption|right]
> ![[M.2.1.26.png]] 
> James's funeral.

James was honored at a memorial service attended by all of his surviving family and friends. He passed away well loved by nearly everyone his life had touched. The guest list was exclusive, and all paparazzi was turned away. After the service, the title of legacy was passed down to Leah, as had been decided by Susan and James before his passing.

## Personality
James lived a life defined by his own impulsivity. Nearly everything he did, from the moment he first ran away from [[Daniela and Ed's|home]], his marriage to [[Susan Harper|Susan]], accepting the legacy armor from [[Victor Feng|Victor]], all the way up to his late-in-life visit to [[Cleary Ranch]] were all spur of the moment decisions that dramatically altered the course of his life. Even if his rashness changed things dramatically for James, he never failed to pivot and keep things on track.

James values his friends and family highly. When he first ran away from home, he knew he wanted to have fun and be social, and he ensured that he had the people around him for that to continue to be a constant in his life. He and Susan were hosting social events even at the end of James's life. When it came to [[Seth Mai|Seth]] and [[Leah Mai|Leah]], James wanted to ensure that he taught them enough about legacies and his own mistakes to set them up for success, but he was also cognizant of [[Daniela Mai|Daniela]] and [[Ed Mai|Ed]]'s mistakes, and was careful not to put too much pressure on themselves.

While James originally ran away to escape expectations, he ended up achieving everything Daniela and Ed had wanted for him, and managed to go even further beyond. Regardless, James lived out his life afraid to reach out to them again. He knew in his heart that he'd achieved so much that there wasn't any way they wouldn't be proud of him, but James compartmentalized and pretended as if [[Oasis Springs]] was frozen in time until it was too late.
