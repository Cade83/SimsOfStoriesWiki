**Sara Dishman** is a character introduced the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. She's the mother of [[Jocelyn Dishman|Jocelyn]].

## Profile
In her early adulthood, Sara founded a wellness brand that she ran out of the home she lived in with her husband, [[Rene Dishman|Rene]], which saw some early success.

As her business went from small time local success to a juggernaut that shipped internationally, Sara chose to tour the area she lived in and host a series of business seminars at various colleges in order to share her knowledge with the next generation. She fell in love with the idea of sharing her experience, which inspired her and Rene to adopt [[Jocelyn Dishman|Jocelyn]] and [[Ivan Dishman|Ivan]].

Sara retired early after she sold her company, wanting to focus on being a mom full-time. She had some difficulties as a parent, as it was rare for Jocelyn and Ivan to get along, resulting in her ultimately choosing to leave the two of them to their own devices when they started arguing. When Jocelyn brought [[Seth Mai]] home, both Sara and Rene were overjoyed, and asked to host his family with eagerness.

Her growing proximity to the Mai Family, however, ultimately proved to be her undoing. A month after Jocelyn's marriage to Seth, [[Hajar Cresques]], an enemy of the Mai Family,  chose to set the [[Dishman House]] to get back at the Mais. Sara and Rene ensured that Ivan escaped, but were unable to survive themselves.

## Personality
Sara is an ever-friendly businesswoman who, as a result of her own success, always wants to give back to others. She did this through seminars, and later through the adoption of [[Jocelyn Dishman|Jocelyn]] and [[Ivan Dishman|Ivan]]. While Sara would be the first to admit that motherhood ultimately wasn't in her, as she wasn't able to properly mediate or deal with their arguments and soon gave up on it, but she was always willing to do anything she could for them.
