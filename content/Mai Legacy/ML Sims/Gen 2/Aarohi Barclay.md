**Aarohi Barclay** is a character introduced in the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. She's a friend to [[James Mai]].

## Profile

> Aarohi meets James for the first time.

Aarohi was born to be an event planer. She enjoyed organizing parties going all the way back to her childhood, and into her college years where she was friends with [[Hajar Cresques]] and studied under [[Rebekah Gossett]], so it only followed that her later career would align. Aarohi got her start planning loud parties with DJs and bonfires that became the talk of the town, as they were heard across town, attracting the ire of [[Victor Feng|Victor]] and [[Lily Feng]] as a result. Aarohi came to fear them, and ended up throwing parties at the [[Windenburg Ruins]] instead, which were heard by [[Rosaline Le Chien]], and she would call her good friends the Fengs to put a stop to them. It was at one of those parties where she first met [[James Mai]].

James, who was friends with the Fengs, got them to speak with and eventually befriend Aarohi at his and [[Susan Harper]]'s baby shower. This newfound relationship allowed her to organize events more officially without attracting law enforcement for noise and light violations. Aarohi became a close family friend of James and Susan, and ended up regularly looking after their children [[Seth Mai|Seth]] and [[Leah Mai|Leah]] in their infancy. She was on watch the night [[Joaquin Le Chien]] and Hajar broke into the [[Mai House]] to get revenge on James and Susan. Joaquin tied her up and threw her in a closet, leaving her with enough trauma to finally expose a secret she'd held onto since her college days- that Hajar was a witch. This information helped James's friend group figure out who was responsible for the break in.

Regardless, Aarohi remained a close friend of James's friend group and the Mai family, and would regularly drop by to check on James, Susan, and their children. Seth and Leah almost saw her as an aunt of theirs. As Seth and Leah started their own romantic pursuits and the rest of her friends began to get married and have children of their own, Aarohi became aware of just how lonely she was. She managed to find [[Joe Barclay|Joe]], and the two married privately and quietly. James and Susan didn't even meet the man until Aarohi was already two months pregnant with [[Teala Barclay|Teala]].

As with most of James's friend group, Aarohi started to drift away as they all got older. She remained eternally grateful for the time she'd had with them, but she recognized that Seth and Leah were their own people now, and that each member of their friend group had their own problems that were more immediately important than each other. She arguably became the most distant out of anyone in the friend group, and any benefits that she'd once had due to her friendship with powerful families like the Mais and the Fengs slowly dried up. While she still attended events where everyone was in attendance, such as memorials, she focused herself on event organizing, her husband Joe, and raising Teala.

## Personality
Despite the loud personality that her career as an event planner would apply, Aarohi is incredibly conflict averse, almost bordering on shy. She has a tendency to flee or make any manner of excuses to get out of any situation that has the potential to be awkward, which is why she never revealed to [[James Mai|James]] and [[Susan Harper|Susan]] that she was a witch as well. When she's at peace, however, Aarohi is an incredibly caring and understanding individual who is always willing to lend a hand to a friend if asked.

Aarohi has a fear of loneliness. She clung onto [[Joe Barclay|Joe]] when he entered her life because she feared it might be her last shot at love and a family, and luckily for her, it worked out. Joe and her daughter [[Teala Barclay|Teala]] proved to be everything to her later in life, and she wouldn't have traded them for anything in the world.
