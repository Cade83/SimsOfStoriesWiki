**Jacques Villareal** is an antagonist in the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. He's the head of the Villareal Family.

## Profile
In his prime, Jacques was considered to be one of the most powerful men in [[Windenburg]]. The land investments he had made in his youth had paid off big time, and he was able to build up his childhood home into an estate for himself, his wife [[Danna Villareal|Danna]], and his oldest son, [[Hugo Villareal|Hugo]]. At around this time, he got into businesses discussions with a young [[Antonio Sanchez]], who had plans that utilized Jacques's land and could make the pair of them even wealthier. Jacques liked what Antonio was offering him, and the pair of them became businesses partners and friends.

Jacques's next two child, [[Luna Villareal|Luna]], got to enjoy all of the privilege of growing up wealthy without any of the consequences, unlike Hugo, who Jacques has begun to train to take over for him on Antonio's recommendation. He kept Luna in mind as a distant second choice, however, as his youngest child, [[Max Villareal|Max]], was unpleasant and would almost certainly mishandle things. This led to Max and Danna feeling rather excluded, as Jacques would rarely ever clue either of them in on what he was thinking.

After Danna disappeared under mysterious circumstances, Jacques thew himself back out into the world. He began to work with [[Ulrike Faust]], a renowned art curator, sourcing her valuable items for a cost, and she would find him paintings that fit his taste in return. Oddest of all was that Jacques started clubbing. It was while he was clubbing that he met [[Akira Kibo]], [[Susan Harper]], and [[Eliza Pancakes]]. He ran into Akira multiple times, and the two struck up a rapport.

Jacques and Akira eventually wed in a ceremony that was met with nationwide scorn, many believing it to be too soon after Danna's passing or simply inappropriate given Akira was barely of age. The media eventually wrote off Akira as a gold digger, and moved on, leaving the two of them to struggle with a difficult relationship. Jacques was constantly struck by pangs of jealousy over Akira's close male friends, leading to conflict with [[Salim Benali]], and later, [[James Mai]]. There were even times he didn't like Akira at all, and wanted him far away from him, so he paid for an apartment in [[San Myshuno]] for him.

> James meets with Jacques and Akira.

Things got really ugly between Jacques and James, especially once Jacques requested to meet James and James stood up for Akira. Swearing his vengeance on James, Jacques later attempted to steal James's legacy armor, knowing that doing so would end the legacy due to his friendship with [[Victor Feng|Victor]] and [[Lily Feng]]. What Jacques didn't count on, however, was that James would be so poor that he wouldn't have a rear exit. His arrest was widely publicized.

> Akira sits at Jacques's bedside.

Jacques was unable to continue to antagonize James, as his health continued to decline. His regular fits of rage were bad for his heart, and in his final days, Jacques was bed-bound. Akira stayed by his bedside as regularly as he could, as he still cared for him despite it all, and could never forget the man he first met at the club. His final cause of death was heart failure.

#### Legacy

> Jacques's funeral.

Jacques's funeral was held in the [[Villareal Mausoleum]], and was attended by his family, friends, and the media. He was mourned by only a select few, but his passing rocked Windenburg. Hugo took over his business ventures with Antonio for him, and did his best to manage the workload Jacques had been dealing with for years.

Privately, Luna and Max were glad he was gone, which was something they would admit to each other many years later. 

## Personality
Jacques dedicated his life to the pursuit of wealth. So much so that he lost himself in it. While it initially began with him wanting the best for his family, he lost his ability to connect with [[Danna Villareal|Danna]], and [[Hugo Villareal|Hugo]] became more of an employee to him than a son with his own dreams and passions. [[Luna Villareal|Luna]] and [[Max Villareal|Max]] would later recognize that they were lucky to not have been old enough for Jacques to do the same to him.

After Danna's disappearance, Jacques became increasingly erratic. He would do things completely outside of his character entirely for the sake of doing them, and his relationship with [[Akira Kibo|Akira]] and the fits of jealousy he'd have over him baffled even the oldest of his friends. His treatment of Akira was also hard to predict, as while it was clear he loved him, there were times where he yelled at him until he left the premises. Whether or not that came from a place of fear stemming from Danna's fate, or was a sudden dislike of Akira is hard to say.
