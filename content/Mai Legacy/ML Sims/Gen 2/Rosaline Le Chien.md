> “You know the Shallot family, correct? Probably not, I'm assuming. The last two owners tragically perished in a fire… a fire set by my Le Chien ancestors when the two legacy families grew too big for tiny Windenburg. Their legacy was so thoroughly scorched from the earth that they're now referred to as the Von Haunts. Don’t even think for a moment that we won’t do the same to you.”

**Rosaline Le Chien** is a character introduced the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. She's the heiress of the Le Chien Legacy at the start of the [[Second Generation]].

## Profile
As the only daughter of a long-running Legacy Family, Rosaline was raised to be an heiress, which was a role she stepped into gracefully. Through television and radio appearances, magazine spreads, and event hosting, Rosaline came to command respect across all of [[Windenburg]]. She married [[Bronson Le Chien|Bronson]] in her mid 20s, which was an event that scandalized the nation, as Bronson didn't come from money, yet Rosaline persisted. As a result, the pair of them became the very picture of a successful romance.

The two of them integrated themselves into high society, and became close friends with [[Victor Feng|Victor]] and [[Lily Feng]], another young couple who ran things in the neighboring city of [[San Myshuno]].  They would both regularly offer each other advice, as they saw each other as equals. At around the same time, they also became some of the prominent beneficiaries behind [[Cassandra Goth]]'s presidential campaign, as they felt that [[Mitch Laurent]] was corrupt, didn't benefit historical families and only himself, and that Cassandra was his biggest opposition. Their financial support helped win Cassandra the presidency, and she promised to aid them in any way she could from then on. This relationship proved to be a boon to them, as it let them win lawsuits they wouldn't have won otherwise once Cassandra built and staffed her [[Goth Brooks Courthouse|courthouse]].

> Rosaline and Bronson talk to Joaquin about Sergio.

[[Joaquin Le Chien|Joaquin]] was born a few years into Rosaline and Bronson's marriage, and Rosaline made sure to raise him as she had been raised- with an understanding of his future role and stressing the importance of defending their family history. When Joaquin first brought [[Sergio Romeo]] home as his future partner, Rosaline and Bronson were surprised, but they had no issue with it. If anything, they disliked Sergio's parents, as they were among the members of high society who had criticized Rosaline's marriage to Bronson. With time, however, they got over even that as Sergio was charming and clearly made their son very happy. Rosaline was ready to hand over the reigns of the legacy to Joaquin, trusting he could lead their family in her stead.

Everything changed when Joaquin's high school friend [[Hajar Cresques]] turned up on their doorstep. The more time Joaquin spent with her, the less he liked Sergio, which considered both Rosaline and Bronson greatly, but nothing they did or said seemed to shake him. Eventually, Joaquin had divorced Sergio, married Hajar, and Rosaline and Bronson ended up living in a house with a woman they weren't all too fond of. Hajar even renovated the house to match her own tastes, bulldozing decades of family history despite Rosaline's protests.

When the Le Chien Legacy was actually threatened, however, Rosaline and Hajar put their differences aside and worked together to attempt to bring an end to [[James Mai]]'s budding legacy. Hajar gathered evidence while Rosaline and Bronson contacted their friends at the [[Goth Brooks Courthouse]] before suing the Mai family to ensure another victory. To their dismay, however, [[Nate Landgraab|Judge Landgraab]] and [[Sarah Goth|Judge Goth]] were no longer working there, and had been replaced by [[Ethan Marshal|Judge Marshal]], who the Le Chiens had no personal relationship with. Judge Marshal ruled against them.

> Rosaline freaks out at court.

Rosaline was ready to give up and at least try to coexist with the Mais, but Hajar took matters into her own hands. The consequences of Hajar's actions blew up in the Le Chien's faces when the Mai's family friends ensured that the Le Chien's legacy armor vanished. They took the Mais back to court, but due to a lack of evidence, and Judge Marshal still being present, they faced no consequences. The Le Chien family was forced to sit around counting the minutes until their legacy was considered forfeit. Rosaline and Bronson both passed away from grief not long after.

## Personality
Rosaline is a woman who can command nearly every situation with grace and poise. Her personality, as well as her love for a commoner like [[Bronson Le Chien|Bronson]], played a large role in her continuing to elevate the Le Chien family in [[Windenburg]]. When it comes to her family history, however, Rosaline gets defensive. She can recall every detail of the Le Chien Legacy, even going as far back as the time of [[Fredrick Le Chien|Fredrick]] and [[Mabel Le Chien|Mabel]], and will do anything to ensure that history continues to endure and prosper. Losing the legacy broke her spirit.
