**Ed Mai** is a character introduced in the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. He's the husband of [[Daniela Mai|Daniela]] the mother of [[James Mai|James]] and [[Jamie Mai|Jamie]].

## Profile
After [[Daniela Mai|Daniela]] retired from her political career, Ed quietly pushed her to move their small family to [[Oasis Springs]], where he could find inspiration as a painter. Daniela agreed, and they bought a [[Daniela and Ed's|small home]] to raise their young son [[James Mai|James]] in.

While Ed focused on his career as a painter, Daniela opened the Mai Resort and Spa and saw great initial success. Ed's painting adorned the walls of the resort, and with time and effort, the both of them became local celebrities. This was only compounded when relationships Daniela had built with [[Nancy Landgraab|Nancy]] and [[Geoffrey Landgraab]] secured them invitations to the illustrious Gala for Gold.

> Ed imagines James's shining future.

With their egos inflated, Ed and Daniela began to believe that they could achieve anything, and they began to put that pressure on James. James, who was interested in painting due to his father, learned a lot from Ed. However, Ed telling James that his paintings would one day hang in [[Casbah Gallery]] scared him, and as the pressure from both Ed and Daniela continued to intensity, James eventually chose to run away from home.

Ed and Daniela tried in vain to locate James, expending much of their fortune and influence in the process, but after a few years passed with no success, they chose to have [[Jamie Mai|Jamie]]. While raising Jamie, they did eventually locate James due to articles about his Legacy Family, but raising a new child in combination with managing the resort kept the pair of them in Oasis Springs. Once Jamie married [[Ty Cleary]], the two moved with her to [[Cleary Ranch]] due to their advanced ages and their resort having fallen on tough times. Ed passed away from cancer before ever reuniting with James.

#### Legacy

> Ed and Daniela's memorial.

After James finally returned to Oasis Springs, met Jamie, and found out about Ed and Daniela's lives after his departure, he was crushed. He admitted to himself and Jamie that he was too scared to face them again after he ran away, and that cutting them out of his life as early as he did was one of his biggest regrets. Upon his return home, James held a memorial service for both Ed and Daniela where he introduced them to the rest of his family.

## Personality
A rather soft spoken man, Ed was always one to let his wife [[Daniela Mai|Daniela]] lead. They both shared grand visions for the future, and would help each other achieve those visions, with Ed regularly helping out with the Mai Resort and Spa. Impressing those grand visions for the future onto their son [[James Mai|James]], however, proved to be their greatest regret.
