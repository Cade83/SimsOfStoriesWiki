**Bronson Le Chien** is a character introduced the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. He's the husband of [[Rosaline Le Chien|Rosaline]].

## Profile
Bronson marrying [[Rosaline Le Chien]] was at one point the talk of all of [[Windenburg]]. He was a nobody, he didn't come from money, and Rosaline's family went back centuries. Never in all of that time had one of the Le Chien Legacy heirs ever chosen to marry someone of a lower social class, yet Rosaline fought for Bronson and won. The two of them faced some ridicule from other members of the social elite, but the majority of people found their love story to be inspiriting, and it ended up elevating the Le Chien family's level of influence.

Despite his ascent into high society being somewhat contentious, Bronson handled things well due to Rosaline's guiding hand. They both befriended [[Victor Feng|Victor]] and [[Lily Feng]], who were the very pinnacle of [[San Myshuno]] high society, and Bronson was later the one who recommended Rosaline back [[Cassandra Goth]] in the presidential election, recognizing that the other candidates would do nothing to help the Le Chien's standing. In return, Rosaline educated him in the Le Chien's family history and how to speak to the social elite.

Bronson and Rosaline gave birth to [[Joaquin Le Chien|Joaquin]] a few years into their marriage, and raised him to understand the magnitude of the role he'd one day inherit. They both came to love [[Sergio Romeo]] when Joaquin brought him home, insisting that he was the one, and the four of them enjoyed a few glorious years together. Everything changed when [[Hajar Cresques]], an old friend of Joaquin's, came back to town. Joaquin began to isolate and fall for her over Sergio, and they were both unable to snap him out of it. Bronson recognized her as someone who was only there for the money and power, but they were unable to do anything to stop Joaquin from marrying her.

Upon hearing that [[James Mai]] was creating a legacy that would rival their legacy, Bronson and Rosaline were forced to work with Hajar to try to put a stop to it. They both recognized that two legacies in proximity never ended well due to the Le Chiens' history with the Shallots, and sued the Mais for threatening their family history and finances. They brought them to the [[Goth Brooks Courthouse]], which has once been staffed by friends of the Le Chien family due to their backing of Cassandra in the election, but this time, they were met by [[Ethan Marshal|Judge Marshal]]. He ruled that both legacies could coexist, disappointing the Le Chiens.

> Bronson and Rosaline reflect on their situation.

While doubtful that they could continue to exist alongside the Mai family, Bronson and Rosaline agreed that they'd done what they could, and they'd try to work with their new sitution. Hajar, on the other hand, had a different idea. She threatened the Mai children, resulting in the Mai's family friends retaliating and ensuring that the legacy armor that legitimized the Le Chien legacy vanished. While they sued again, the Le Chiens lacked the evidence to prove any wrongdoing, and their legacy eventually expired. Both Bronson and Rosaline passed away from grief not long after.

## Personality
While [[Rosaline Le Chien|Rosaline]] was always be the one to lead conversations, Bronson was the more analytical of the two. He'd recognize what the intentions of others were, then contribute his thoughts to turn things around. Through Rosaline, he developed a great love for Le Chien family history on top of the love he already had for Rosaline and [[Joaquin Le Chien|Joaquin]], and he'd do anything to protect them.
