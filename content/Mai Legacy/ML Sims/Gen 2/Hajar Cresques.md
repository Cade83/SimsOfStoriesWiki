**Hajar Cresques**, typically referred to as **Hajar Le Chien**, is the primary antagonist in the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]].  She married into the Le Chien Legacy through [[Joaquin Le Chien]], and is dedicated to ensuring its survival.

## Profile

> Hajar whispers to Joaquin.

Hajar first met [[Joaquin Le Chien]] in high school, where she became one of his closest friends. She watched as he fell for [[Sergio Romeo]], and a part of her was jealous. Joaquin has her person, she benefited from his wealth and influence, and she hated that he'd choose anyone over her. As his best friend, Hajar knew a lot about Joaquin's personal life, and tried to turn it against him to make him walk away from Sergio. She'd tell him that his parents wouldn't approve, that he and Sergio couldn't have children to continue the legacy, but it was all for naught. 

Hajar was separated from Joaquin when she went off to college to study science, where she befriended [[Aarohi Barclay]]. While there, she roomed with [[Fatima Mansouri]], a woman who had already studied a bit of witchcraft. Inspired, Hajar became a witch herself, and even studied briefly under [[Elaine Oldham]] to master the art of alchemy. She became good enough to eventually mentor Fatima herself. With her newfound knowledge, Hajar showed up on Joaquin's doorstep, and began to whisper doubts about Sergio to him again. This time, however, they were laced with magic that would last as long as she could keep him from pining for Sergio.

Under Hajar's influence, Joaquin eventually fell out of love with Sergio and divorced him. He and Hajar were wed not long after. Hajar could recognize that Joaquin's parents [[Rosaline Le Chien|Rosaline]] and [[Bronson Le Chien|Bronson]] didn't like her nearly as much as they'd liked Sergio, but she chose to ignore it, as she'd gotten everything she'd wanted. The man, the legacy, and the influence. All of this was brought to a screeching halt when Joaquin told her that [[James Mai]] and [[Susan Harper]] were trying to start a legacy of their own that would exist in opposition to the Le Chien's Legacy.

> Hajar barges into the Mai House.

Working together with Rosaline and Bronson, Hajar marched into the [[Mai House]], took a picture of their legacy armor for evidence, then the Mais were served with a lawsuit that required them to fly out to the [[Goth Brooks Courthouse]], as Rosaline and Bronson had connections there. To their disappointment, [[Ethan Marshal|Judge Marshal]] ruled that two legacies could coexist, and the Le Chiens were unable to do anything about the Mai Legacy.

Enraged, Hajar refused to let the Mais win, and had Joaquin take her to the [[Von Haunt Estate]], where Joaquin's ancestors had built a secret room beneath a hedge maze that allowed them to orchestrate the downfall of the Shallots. While they'd originally gone to look for inspiration on how to exact revenge on the Mai family, Hajar found potions, and while claiming that she'd picked up a little bit from the witch she roomed with in college, brewed up a potion that would age James and Susan's children.

James and Leah's friends retaliated in turn, and made the Le Chien's legacy armor disappear overnight. Without their legacy armor, the Le Chien's legacy was rendered invalid, something no one in that house was going to take lying down. Everyone flew back to the Goth Brooks Courthouse, where no matter how hard Hajar, Joaquin, or Joaquin's parents fought, they were unable to do anything to the Mai family, as there was no evidence they'd done anything.

> Hajar looks back at the burning Dishman House.

Hajar dedicated the rest of her life to trying to get back at the Mai family. It was all consuming for her. None of the births of her three children, [[Julianne Le Chien|Julianne]], [[Pace Le Chien|Pace]], or [[Korbin Le Chien|Korbin]] put her off of it. When an ill-fated plan to out [[Seth Mai]] was shut down by Joaquin and Seth later fell for [[Jocelyn Dishman]], Hajar decided that Joaquin had given up, as her leaking that news could have scared Jocelyn off. Taking matters into her own hands, Hajar decided that if she couldn't take action against the Mais, she'd do something to someone close to them, and she set fire to the [[Dishman House]]. [[Sara Dishman|Sara]] and [[Rene Dishman]] died in the fire, leaving their son [[Ivan Dishman|Ivan]] as the sole survivor.

> Hajar makes her final request.

With no evidence outside of a photo she took and sent to Joaquin, Hajar was never implicated, as Joaquin didn't have the heart to turn her in. As she aged, however, her health waned, and she was bed-bound most days. Hajar weaponized her poor health to get Joaquin to take one final act against the Mai family, insisting that it was her final wish. At her request, Joaquin set fire to Susan's garden using the same lighter she'd used to set fire to the Dishman's house.

> Joaquin wheels Hajar into the courtroom.

In response, the Mai family sued the Le Chiens, and once again, the four of them were gathered at the Goth Brooks Courthouse. Despite her poor health, Hajar demanded to be there in person to argue her case. While in the heat of the moment, Hajar got up and walked over to Judge Marshal to argue her case more directly, but the exertion and emotional intensity resulted in a heart attack. As she laid on the floor dying, Joaquin let her die, then told her good riddance.

## Personality
An incredibly self-motivated woman, Hajar will do anything to ensure the betterment of her quality of life. Both her pursuit of [[Joaquin Le Chien|Joaquin]] and magic were done in her own self-interest. Others, such as [[Rosaline Le Chien|Rosaline]] and [[Bronson Le Chien|Bronson]], noticed this fact about her, but Hajar was never one to let the opinions of others affect her.

Hajar is also defined by her dedication. Once she settles on something, she will do anything to ensure she reaches her goal, even if getting there involves seriously injuring or killing people in the process. Her words are similarly barbed, as she'll boldly speak her mind without fear of retribution.
