**Rene Dishman** is a character introduced the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. He's the father of [[Jocelyn Dishman|Jocelyn]].

## Profile
Rene and [[Sara Dishman|Sara]] lived a quiet few years together before Sara founded a wellness brand that she ran out of their house, which saw some early local success.

As Sara's business went from its initial success to a juggernaut that shipped internationally, Rene chose to quit his job and reposition himself as Sara's assistant and manager. He was with her every step of the way as she began giving a series of business seminars at local colleges to share her experience with the next generation. These seminars ultimately convinced Rene and Sara to adopt [[Jocelyn Dishman|Jocelyn]] and [[Ivan Dishman|Ivan]].

When Sara chose to sell her company and retire early, Rene was forced to follow the same career trajectory, and both became parents full-time. Jocelyn and Ivan fought a lot, and neither Rene or Sara were sure of how to handle that. While Sara gave up rather quickly, Rene always offered his guidance, even if it wasn't ever effective. When Jocelyn brought [[Seth Mai]] home, both Rene and Sara were overjoyed, and asked to host his family with eagerness.

His growing proximity to the Mai Family, however, ultimately proved to be his undoing. A month after Jocelyn's marriage to Seth, [[Hajar Cresques]], an enemy of the Mai Family,  chose to set the [[Dishman House]] to get back at the Mais. Rene and Sara ensured that Ivan escaped, but were unable to survive themselves.

## Personality
Rene is a man of few words. It's rare for him to speak at all, but he's always listening intently. This ability to listen let him be a strong partner to [[Sara Dishman|Sara]], and helped him better connect with [[Jocelyn Dishman|Jocelyn]] and [[Ivan Dishman|Ivan]] in the small ways he could.
