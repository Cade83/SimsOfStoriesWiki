**Daniela Mai** is a character introduced in the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]]. She's the wife of [[Ed Mai|Ed]] the mother of [[James Mai|James]] and [[Jamie Mai|Jamie]].

## Profile
Daniela moved her family to [[Oasis Springs]] after she retired from her small time political career. Desiring a quieter life for herself, and a better environment for her husband [[Ed Mai|Ed]] to pursue his career as a painter, they bought a [[Daniela and Ed's|small home]] to raise their young son [[James Mai|James]] in. Daniela got to work and opened the Mai Resort and Spa.

Daniela moved quickly and was sure to establish ties with [[Nancy Landgraab]], the CEO of Landgraab Industries. She wanted to establish ties with local businesses and hopefully benefit from a friendship with Landgraab Industries, which provided electricity to much of Oasis Springs. Doing so secured her and Ed an invitation to Nancy's illustrious Gala for Gold, which was the first of many events for the rich and famous they managed to worm their way into. They achieved status in prestige, but only in Oasis Springs.

> Daniela preaches to James.

Convinced that the pair of them had achieved success, Ed and especially Daniela began to put pressure on James to achieve just as much as they had. They ended up putting so much pressure on him that James chose to run away rather than deal with their expectations, leaving the pair of them childless. Devastated, the two of them tried in vain to locate their son, expending all of their fortune and influence in the process, but after a few years of no success, they chose to have [[Jamie Mai|Jamie]] and try again.

Daniela and Ed did manage to find out about James's whereabouts through newspaper clippings that detailed his new life as the founder of a Legacy Family, but the pair of them were so busy with the resort that they never managed to fly out to meet James again. They could only maintain hope that James would return himself. Once Jamie married [[Ty Cleary]], they shut down the resort, which was struggling financially, and moved to [[Cleary Ranch]] with her due to their advanced ages. Daniela begged Jamie to reach out to James on her behalf before she passed, but Jamie refused, believing that James didn't deserve it.

#### Legacy

> Daniela and Ed's memorial.

After James finally returned to Oasis Springs, met Jamie, and found out about Daniela and Ed's lives after his departure, he was crushed. He admitted to himself and Jamie that he was too scared to face them again after he ran away, and that cutting them out of his life as early as he did was one of his biggest regrets. Upon his return home, James held a memorial service for both Daniela and Ed where he introduced them to the rest of his family.

## Personality
Daniela is a woman who radiates confidence. Some would argue she had an excess of confidence, but she would always believe otherwise. She expected great things of herself and her family, and was always willing to step up and do what was needed to be done to achieve whatever it was she wanted.
