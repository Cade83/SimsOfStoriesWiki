**Joaquin Le Chien** is a character in the first chapter of [[Mai Legacy]].  He's the heir to the Le Chien Legacy, which is a direct rival to [[James Mai]]'s Mai Legacy.

## Profile

> Young Joaquin with his parents.

Joaquin was raised with the understanding that one day, it would be his duty to inherit and lead his family's legacy. Despite that expectation of him, however, his parents [[Rosaline Le Chien|Rosaline]] and [[Bronson Le Chien|Bronson]] ensured that he had a peaceful and carefree childhood.

> Joaquin and Sergio as prom kings.

The way he was raised led to him developing a bit of an ego that carried over to his school life, where Joaquin lording over others resulted in him rising to the top of the [[Windenburg Secondary School|secondary school]] food chain and being surrounded by friends. He became known for throwing incredible parties that he'd invite the entire school to, which he would then DJ. Joaquin had one rival however- [[Sergio Romeo]]. Sergio didn't bow down to Joaquin like the rest of the school, and their fights became the stuff of legend. One fateful day, the two of them were assigned to a school project together, and while at [[Romeo House|Sergio's]], the two admitted their attraction to each other and became an it couple. The pair of them even won prom king together at the end of the year.

> Joaquin proposes to Sergio.

Joaquin's best friend at the time, [[Hajar Cresques]], was never a fan of Sergio and would always express her doubts in him, but once Hajar went off to university, Joaquin proposed to Sergio, and Sergio became part of the Le Chien Legacy. The pair of them lived happily together for a few years until Hajar reentered Joaquin's life, and began to fill him with doubt again. As time passed, Hajar's words took root in Joaquin's mind, and he began to fall out of love with Sergio. Eventually, the two of them got divorced, and Joaquin married Hajar shortly after.

> Joaquin meets James at the ruins.

Hajar began to call the shots, and even remodeled the [[Le Chien House]] to fit her tastes. Left to his own devices, Joaquin continued on as a DJ and continued the morning jogs he used to do with Sergio alone. It had been on one of those morning jogs when he'd met [[James Mai]], a new neighbor of his, which led to him being invited to a party at the [[Windenburg Ruins]]. At that party, Joaquin discovered that James was interested in founding a legacy of his own that would directly conflict with the one he'd been tasked with protecting. He brought the news back to Hajar and his parents, and Hajar took immediate action.

> Joaquin speaks in court.

Hajar, with the assistance of Rosaline and Bronson, sued the Mai family for trying to compete with an established legacy, and required that they all attend court at the [[Goth Brooks Courthouse]], which had been run by close friends of the Le Chien family in years past. They were certain they'd get the outcome they wanted again. Joaquin spoke on behalf of his family as the current heir, and James spoke on behalf of his. [[Ethan Marshal|Judge Marshal]] declared that both legacies could coexist, disappointing the Le Chien family.

> Joaquin guides Hajar through the Von Haunt hedgemaze.

While Rosaline and Bronson accepted Judge Marshal's ruling, Hajar was determined to take things into her own hands, and dragged Joaquin along with her. Utilizing the family history between the Le Chien and the Shallot family, Joaquin and Hajar uncovered the secret room at the [[Von Haunt Estate]] built by Joaquin's ancestors [[Fredrick Le Chien|Fredrick]] and [[Mabel Le Chien|Mabel]]. The secret room contained potions and chemicals Fredrick and Mabel had stockpiled for the purpose of taking the Shallot family down, some of which Hajar recognized. She brewed up a potion that would age the Mai family's children, wanting to strip the Mai family of history. In retaliation, the Mai's friends ensured that the Le Chien's legacy armor vanished, ending the Le Chien Legacy. The Le Chiens dragged the Mais back to court, but with nothing to implicate them, the Le Chiens were left without justice.

> Joaquin listens to Hajar go on about revenge.

After Joaquin's parents passed, he was subjected to Hajar's burning desire for revenge. They bugged [[Myshuno Meadows]] when [[Akira Kibo]] and [[Salim Benali]] got married, but as Hajar kept pressing on, Joaquin got increasingly exhausted. They were the parents to 3 children, and Hajar was more concerned with revenge than being a mother. He began to miss Sergio, which was something which Hajar quickly shut down. He chose to play no part in her later schemes, and began to realize that over time, he and his family had become the villains. Even if Hajar refused to hear it, they'd been beaten, and should accept it and move on.

> Hajar makes her final request.

While on her death bed, Hajar made one final request of Joaquin- that he exact one final revenge on the Mai family. While resistant at first, he eventually gave into Hajar's demands, and burned down [[Susan Harper]]'s garden. This time, the Mai family sued and forced everyone to fly out to the Goth Brooks Courthouse. Joaquin didn't lead this time, as Hajar stepped up instead. Shortly into the court proceedings, Hajar dropped dead from a heart attack. Rather than choosing to save her, Joaquin told her good riddance.

> Joaquin walks away from James for the last time.

As everyone exited the courthouse, James tried to approach Joaquin, but Joaquin told him off, telling him their families would never be on good terms, and that it was best if they didn't interact. Joaquin passed not long after Hajar's passing, leaving his three children [[Julianne Le Chien|Julianne]], [[Pace Le Chien|Pace]], and [[Korbin Le Chien|Korbin]] the family house and everything he had in his will.

## Personality
In his youth, Joaquin had a bit of an ego, and believed the world should be handed to him, as it had been throughout his early life due to the way [[Rosaline Le Chien|Rosaline]] and [[Bronson Le Chien|Bronson]] raised him. His life in high school only reaffirmed this, as he was insanely popular, his biggest rival [[Sergio Romeo]] fell in love with him, and he still had a legacy and wealth to come home to every day. Despite his ego, Joaquin wasn't unkind, and would help out others if he felt like it, such as him directing [[James Mai]] towards karaoke night.

Marrying [[Hajar Cresques]], losing his legacy, and failing his family all slowly broke Joaquin. Initially, he was filled with a self-defensive rage, as James and [[Susan Harper]] establishing a legacy that challenge his went against everything he'd been taught his whole life. Even once everything was lost, Hajar stayed angry, while Joaquin wanted to simply live his life. He wanted to raise his kids in peace, and telling Hajar about the Mai Legacy came to be his biggest regret. Near the end of his life, he recognized that he and Hajar had become villains, and wished that he could have kept his mouth shut and enjoyed the friend group James had invited him to be part of that one day at the ruins.
