> Sergio argues with Joaquin at school.

Initially homeschooled, Sergio was enrolled in the same high school as [[Joaquin Le Chien]] after Joaquin had already become rather popular. Unlike everyone else, Sergio wasn't impressed by Joaquin. Having come from a similarly high class background, Sergio wasn't impressed by Joaquin, and he wasn't afraid to let him know it.

> The tension was undeniable.

One fateful day, however, the two were assigned to the same school project together. While working together while at Sergio's house, the tension was undeniable, and the two made a move on each other. After that day, the two became the school's new it-couple, and even won prom king together.

> Joaquin throws Sergio out.

After graduation, Sergio and Joaquin wed, and Sergio moved into the [[Le Chien House]]. Joaquin's parents [[Rosaline Le Chien|Rosaline]] and [[Bronson Le Chien|Bronson]] grew to love him, and were excited for the future of a legacy headed by Joaquin and Sergio. Everything changed when Joaquin's old friend [[Hajar Cresques]] showed up on the front doorstep. Suddenly, Joaquin began to turn on Sergio, and doubt that he was the best thing for him. Within a matter of months, Joaquin had drawn up divorce papers, and Sergio was asked to leave. Hajar than took his place, and Sergio and Joaquin never saw each other again.
