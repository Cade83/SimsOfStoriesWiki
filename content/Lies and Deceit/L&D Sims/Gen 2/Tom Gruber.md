## Profile

> Tom meets Judith-Noelle at the bar.

Tom was an athlete in college, and always found himself surrounded by his friends and admirers. He first met [[Judith-Noelle Gruber|Judith-Noelle]] when she was working at a [[Witch of the Grey's Bar|local bar]], where she jokingly pretending his ID was fake. After Judith-Noelle got off work, the two of them started talking and drinking, and ended up going home together. They had a one night stand that ended up in Judith-Noelle becoming pregnant with [[Daniel Gruber|Daniel]] and [[Priscilla Gruber|Priscilla]], which got the two of them to start spending time together. The two of them ended up falling for each other and ending up marrying.

Tom was Judith-Noelle's biggest supporter throughout her presidential campaign. He would handle things at home when she was busy, and was sure to be there for every important occasion of hers.

## Personality
Tom is a man always in pursuit of fun and quick and immediate satisfaction. He loves to drink, he loves to party, and he loves to play basketball and the rush of winning a bet. Tom isn't the sort of man who can maintain any sort of job, a fact that bothers both him and [[Judith-Noelle Gruber|Judith-Noelle]], so he drinks to forget, further exasperating the issue. When Tom drinks, he loses control of his inhibitions, and can be rather nasty as he inflicts his own internal frustrations with himself and his family's situation on others.

Despite everything, however, Tom is a family man. He has a great deal of love for Judith-Noelle and his children, and tries to help out in his own way, such as through negotiating rent down with [[Ervin Stuart|Ervin]] or being there to give advice when its needed. His drinking problem unfortunately keeps a wall between himself and his family, which is yet another frustration that drives him to the bottle.
