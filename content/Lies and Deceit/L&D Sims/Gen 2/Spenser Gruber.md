**Spenser Gruber** is one of the protagonists of the first chapter of [[Lies and Deceit]]. He's the son of [[Judith-Noelle Gruber|Judith-Noelle]] and [[Tom Gruber|Tom]].

## Profile

## Personality
Spenser grew up seeing the consequences of [[Judith-Noelle Gruber|Judith-Noelle]]'s political failings on his family, and swore to himself that he would singlehandedly raise his family from poverty through whatever means necessary. He's not above lying to achieve his goals, and he does so to convince [[Naomi Foye|Naomi]] to go into business with him as a 'PR Manager'. Evidently, Spenser has a bit of an ego, and expects his family name to carry wait that it simply does not. He lacks confidence in the capabilities of his siblings and his parents, which is why he put saving his family on himself.
