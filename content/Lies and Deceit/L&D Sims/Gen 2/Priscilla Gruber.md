**Priscilla Gruber** is one of the protagonists of the first chapter of [[Lies and Deceit]]. She's the twin sister of [[Daniel Gruber|Daniel]].

## Profile

## Personality
While Priscilla is one of the two oldest siblings in the Gruber family, she's always refused the responsibility that comes with her age. She enjoys teasing her siblings, and being unabashedly herself, and having to be the responsible one was ill opposed to how she wants to live out her life.

Priscilla is nearly inseparable from her twin brother,Â [[Daniel Gruber|Daniel]], and the pair of them do almost everything together. Any secrets the two of them have are shared between each other, and Priscilla's rather bold approach to life and vulgarity are complimented by Daniel's dry and sarcastic sense of humor.
