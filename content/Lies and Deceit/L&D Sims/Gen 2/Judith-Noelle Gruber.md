> Judith-Noelle drinks with Tom.

Judith-Noelle went to college to study political science, and in her senior year, she took up work at a [[Witch of the Grey's Bar|local bar]]. It was while working at that bar where she met [[Tom Gruber|Tom]] for the first time. After Judith-Noelle got off, the two of them drank together, started flirting, and eventually had a one night stand. All of this resulted in Judith-Noelle ending up pregnant with [[Daniel Gruber|Daniel]] and [[Priscilla Gruber|Priscilla]]. This drove her to reach out to Tom, and once the two began spending time together, they fell for each other, and eventually wed.

After gradation, Judith-Noelle found a job quickly, and through hard work and determination, she eventually found herself at the head of the company, after being picked over [[Gretchen Zhou]]. As the head of the company, she became the face of their political campaign, which focused on creating a better world for the next generation. Judith-Noelle ended up losing the election, which was something she recognized during her debate against the other candidates, but she remained strong throughout her campaign party.

## Personality
Judith-Noelle is a woman who will do anything to ensure her family's perfection and long-term success. Despite her political failings, she starts over and works hard at [[Beauchamp Law]] to provide, and even stays with [[Tom Gruber|Tom]] despite their struggling marriage for the sake of preserving her idealized version of a perfect family. Judith-Noelle abandoned many of her dreams and goals for herself as a result.

The fact that her family is far from perfect is an idea Judith-Noelle struggles with. She tries her best keeps her martial issues with Tom a secret from her family, as others being aware of it would shatter her flimsy illusion of perfection. This has led to a degree of isolation between herself and others- she's close with her family in the role of a mother, but struggles to maintain friendships, as she has a hard time opening up to others. Judith-Noelle has become rather lonely as a result, which is a far cry from her bartender days, which she looks back on with nostalgia and regret.

Regardless of her own personal struggles, Judith-Noelle maintains the facade of the chipper mother of four at all hours of the day, and it takes a lot for her to drop it.
