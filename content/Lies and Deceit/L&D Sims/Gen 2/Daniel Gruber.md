**Daniel Gruber** is one of the protagonists of the first chapter of [[Lies and Deceit]]. He's the twin brother of [[Priscilla Gruber|Priscilla]].

## Profile

## Personality
As one half of the oldest of the Gruber siblings, Daniel took on a somewhat parental role for his siblings. He's the go to for any advice, and is good at mediating arguments and determining solutions.

Daniel is nearly inseparable from his twin sister, [[Priscilla Gruber|Priscilla]], and the pair of them do almost everything together. Any secrets the two of them have are shared between each other, and Daniel's rather dry and sarcastic sense of humor compliments Priscilla's vulgarity and boldness.
