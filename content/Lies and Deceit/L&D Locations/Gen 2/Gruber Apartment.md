The **Gruber Apartment** is a location in the first chapter of [[Lies and Deceit]]. It's the home [[Judith-Noelle Gruber|Judith-Noelle]] and [[Tom Gruber]] raised their four children in.

## Profile
The Gruber apartment is located in an old building in central [[Britechester]] that was inherited by [[Ervin Stuart]] and converted into apartments. It was at one time a factory with living quarters for workers. 

Ervin rents out the apartment to the Gruber family at a reduced price due to his friendship with [[Tom Gruber|Tom]], but both Tom and Ervin keep that from the rest of Tom's family. Regardless, the apartment is a tight squeeze for the Gruber family, with all four Gruber children crammed into a single room with bunkbeds.
