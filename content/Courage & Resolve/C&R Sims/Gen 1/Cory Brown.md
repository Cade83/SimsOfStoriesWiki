## Profile

> Cory plays with Booker.

Cory and his sister [[Jamira Brown|Jamira]] were raised by [[Amelia Brown|Amelia]] with love and care. While Jamira was always curious about their [[Samson Brown|father]], Cory wasn't nearly as concerned with him at the time. He'd rather spend his time playing with his friends [[Booker Aston]] and [[Sheena Morrin]]. Once Amelia told him and Jamira everything and he met Samson, however, Cory developed a curiosity. He disliked the man, and grew to hate him after he tried to abduct him and his sister, but part of him always wondered how he got to that point in his life.

> Cory shoots hoops with Booker.

As an adult, Cory developed an interest in basketball, and began to shoot hoops with Booker multiple times a week. He was positive that with enough effort, this would be enough for him to go pro.

## Personality
In comparison to his [[Jamira Brown|sister]], Cory is significantly more level-headed. He regularly takes on the role of reigning her in when the things she says get too outlandish.

Cory also has a deep interest in his own family history, and how it relates to his image of himself. He tends to get concerned about how he and his family look, and after seeing how bad [[Samson Brown|Samson]] was, he began to wonder what sharing DNA with that man meant.
