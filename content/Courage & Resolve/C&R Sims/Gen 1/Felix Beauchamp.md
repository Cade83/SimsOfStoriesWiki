**Felix Beauchamp** is a character in the first chapter of [[Courage & Resolve]]. He is the head of [[Beauchamp Law]].

## Profile
Felix first met the love of his life, [[Genevieve Beauchamp|Genevieve]], while he was studying law in college. While he was too socially anxious to initiate any kind of conversation with her, she got things started with him. This dynamic continued on into their relationship, and later work life, with Genevieve being the one to propose to Felix and later act as his intermediary source of communication with his employees at [[Beauchamp Law]].

Felix founded Beauchamp Law to make the law more transparent to a wider audience. He noticed that the vast majority of the public found the law unfair, or inherently confusing, and he wanted to do his best to remedy that. Beauchamp Law struggled at first, requiring him to hire anyone who applied in the beginning, and then once they saw some moderate success, Felix tried to expand too early, and was then forced to lay off a large number of employees. Genevieve always insisted that the firm treated each of their employees as a family, but Felix's actions, from layoffs, to his refusal to interact with his employees, didn't do much to show it. Once Felix began to pursue the [[President|presidency]], and [[Mitch Laurent]] personally reached out to offer his aid, he began to pay even less attention to Beauchamp Law, and Genevieve was left running things.

Unbeknown to Felix, an employee of his by the name of [[Amelia Brown]] was having issues with another employee, [[Stefan Barrens]]. He'd been harassing her for months, and when Amelia had tried to approach Felix to ask him to solve the situation, Genevieve had shooed her away. Pushing to her breaking point, Amelia recorded the harassment and submitted it to the local news, fully aware of the fact that Felix was preparing a presidential campaign and this could ruin him. This all came as a wakeup call to Felix, and he personally apologized to Amelia, and then swore to do better as a CEO, and open his door to his employees, regardless of how busy he was.

As the Presidential Debates grew nearer, Felix doubled down on making his campaign feel like a movement, even hosting a massive campaign party for his friends, donors, and political colleagues. At the [[Windenburg Debate Stage|debates]] themselves, Mitch noticed how nervous Felix was, and grew to doubt his choice in his successor, but he continued to advice him anyway, telling him to avoid mentioning any relation to him because he was an unpopular president. Felix emphasized clarity of the law and its consequences and an increase in government investment as his running polices. One of his opponents, [[Cassandra Goth]], noticed when he slipped up and referred to Mitch by his first name, and made sure to point it out to the audience.

Felix ended up placing third, and did not qualify for the final round of the debates. Officially out of the running, Felix almost breathed a sigh of relief. Over the course of his campaign, he'd come to realize that he wasn't cut out for the role of president. His place of comfort would always be Beauchamp Law, alongside Genevieve and people he'd grown to treasure, like Amelia. With renewed focus, Felix rededicated himself to Beauchamp Law, and continued to grow the company, opening branches in every corner of the globe. His work and dedication to the clarity of the law was an inspiration to his children [[Connor Beauchamp|Connor]] and [[Elise Beauchamp|Elise]], who both studied law and became defense attorneys.

## Personality
Felix is a man who cares deeply about the state of the world, and much of his actions in life reflect that. He founded [[Beauchamp Law]] to make law more transparent to a broader audience, recognized that [[Amelia Brown|Amelia]] was suffering and adjusted his policies at the firm, and finally, he stepped out of his comfort zone to attempt a run for [[President|president]].

He's also a man ruled by social anxiety, however, and he's reliant on his wife [[Genevieve Beauchamp|Genevieve]] to keep things moving. Felix is great on the phone, but terrible at face to face conversations, let alone public speaking, so he let her handle all of that for him. Felix has complete and utter trust in Genevieve, yet he also dislikes her relentless pursuit of perfection, as he recognizes that he himself is imperfect.
