> [!quote|author] Stefan demanding Amelia's office.
> “I want you to listen closely, Amelia. I’m sure we both know that I deserved that promotion just as much as you did. More so, actually. I’ve been working here for nearly as long as your have, and much harder."

**Stefan Barrens** is a character in the first chapter of [[Courage & Resolve]]. He is an employee at [[Beauchamp Law]].

## Profile
Stefan was hired at [[Beauchamp Law]] within the same time period as [[Amelia Brown]], when the firm was desperate for employees and would hire anyone with a law degree. While he got work done, a lot of what Stefan did was subpar, as he tended to hang out near the coffee machine, harassing women who walked by with the hope that one of them would be willing to go out with him. Stefan and Amelia both weathered the storm that was the collapse of the second location, yet, to Stefan's surprise, Amelia was promoted to an individual office ahead of him.

> Stefan harasses Amelia in her new office.

Stefan was very bothered by Amelia's promotion. In his mind, he was more qualified than her because they'd been at Beauchamp Law for around the same period of time, and he was more devoted to the company than her. Amelia had other priorities, such as her children, and therefore couldn't give the company the same level of attention that he could. Stefan decided to dedicate his time in the office to harassing Amelia, pelting her with cruel words about her living situation in the hopes that it would result in Amelia telling their manager, [[Genevieve Beauchamp]], that Stefan was more deserving than her. Amelia grew sick of the abuse, and recorded a video of Stefan insulting her which she released to local news agencies. Stefan was fired within the day.

> Samson meets with Stefan in the lobby of his [[Treefall Inn|hotel]].

Wanting to get back at Amelia, Stefan jumped at the opportunity to work alongside her ex-husband, [[Samson Brown]], when he wanted to sue her for full custody of their children, [[Jamira Brown|Jamira]] and [[Cory Brown|Cory]]. Stefan warned Samson against using the Beauchamps, and gave him advice based on his experience of Amelia from their many years as coworkers. He recommended that Samson approach Amelia with an emotional appeal, and talk about how badly he wanted to be a father. Stefan's advice worked, and Amelia allowed Samson to meet his children.

> Stefan realizes what Samson has done.

At the meeting with his children, Samson came to realize that his children wouldn't love him of their own accord, and he blamed Stefan for it because the meeting was his idea. He demanded that Stefan come up with a new plan. After some time, Stefan approached Samson with the floor plan of [[Jo Kauffman]]'s [[Jo's House|house]], which showed a basement that had been covered up. Stefan planned for the two of them to interrogate Jo for information, and find an angle they could use to argue that Amelia was an unfit mother. During the interrogation, Jo refused to give up any information, and Samson struck her in a fit of rage. Jo did not survive. Stefan helped Samson stage the murder as a fall so neither of them were implicated, then he deleted Samson's number and vanished.

> Stefan walks away from Jo's funeral.

Stefan felt a great degree of guilt for what happened to Jo. While he knew he wasn't the one who killed her, he still felt responsible. After cutting ties with Samson, he observed Jo's funeral from a distance, and heard Amelia's eulogy. Stefan surprised himself when her words brought him to tears. Amelia's words, combined with the knowledge that he was somewhat responsible for Jo's death were a wakeup call for Stefan, and he came to realize how much having personal connections can mean for someone.

## Personality
In Stefan's world, he is at the center of the universe. He believes that everyone should recognize his hard work and achievement, and if that achievement came at the expense of others, it wasn't his problem. His overinflated ego wasn't backed up by his own talent and work ethic, however, which led to him stagnating in his professional and love life. He was at his most motivated when trying to hurt [[Amelia Brown|Amelia]] through [[Samson Brown|Samson]], and proved to himself that he could actually be a decent lawyer if he actually put his mind to it.

[[Jo Kauffman|Jo]]'s death shattered Stefan's worldview and understanding of his own self. According to his previous logic, with Jo dead, Amelia hurt, and him and Samson getting away with her murder, it should have been a net gain for him. Yet, Stefan was consumed with guilt. He recognized how many lives Jo had touched, and came to realize that being a positive influence in the lives of others might actually be more of a net positive than a tireless pursuit of career and sexual achievements.
