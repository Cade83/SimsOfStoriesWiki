> Amelia comforts Jamira about her lack of a father.

Jamira and her brother [[Cory Brown|Cory]] were raised by [[Amelia Brown|Amelia]] with love and care. While Jamira always had questions about her [[Samson Brown|father]] growing up, she respected that her mom didn't want to talk about it. When she finally did learn the truth from Amelia, Jamira grew to hate the man, and she wasn't fooled when he tried to reenter their lives under the guise of a good father. Her suspicions were proven right when Samson showed up at night with a gun to try to abduct Jamira and her brother.

## Personality
Unlike her [[Amelia Brown|mother]], Jamira grew up to be completely unafraid of confrontation. She's always willing to say exactly what she thinks and stand by those words.
