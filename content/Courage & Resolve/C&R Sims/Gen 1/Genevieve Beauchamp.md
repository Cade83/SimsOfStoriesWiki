**Genevieve Beauchamp** is a character in the first chapter of [[Courage & Resolve]]. While her husband, [[Felix Beauchamp]], is the CEO of [[Beauchamp Law]], she's the one who keeps the business running.

## Profile
Genevieve met [[Felix Beauchamp|Felix]] while she was studying marketing in college. While she was immediately attracted to him, Felix refused to respond to her affections, not even speaking to her for the first month. Genevieve came to recognize that getting Felix to socialize with her would take work, but she was dedicated, and those efforts did slowly get him to open. Even though she had to do the proposal herself, the two wed, and Genevieve couldn't be happier.

The two of them opened [[Beauchamp Law]] together, with Felix wanting to make the law more transparent and fair, and Genevieve fully behind him. While Felix dealt with the legal things, Genevieve started out focusing on the firm's image, and put forth the idea that they were a company who treated every employee like family. Felix, however, was so antisocial that a lot of that image felt flimsy at best, so Genevieve stepped in as his intermediary and would tell anyone who wanted to meet with Felix that he was busy. Beauchamp Law floundered at first, but they eventually managed to open multiple locations worldwide.

When [[Amelia Brown]] felt so distant from Felix that she felt as if it was nessacary to publicly release a video that showed [[Stefan Barrens]] harassing her for things to change, Genevieve was horrified and somewhat offended. She'd previously told Amelia she could come to her with anything, but Amelia felt as if it had to be Felix for something this serious. Felix swore to adjust his approach towards his employees, while Genevieve dedicated herself to making things right with Amelia. She broke company policy to tell her when her ex-husband, [[Samson Brown]], came to town seeking custody of their children, and the two eventually became good friends.

Felix's [[President|presidential campaign]] was always something that both excited and scared Genevieve. She recognized that poor antisocial Felix would likely struggle at the job, and she worried about how any failure on his part might reflect on her and Beauchamp Law, but she was also excited for everything he'd be able to achieve in that position of power. As the Presidential Debates grew nearer, Genevieve threw herself into showing unflagging support for Felix, even throwing a lavish campaign party for him that she invited an abundance of important people and friends to. When Felix came in third in that round of the Presidential Debates, and lost the presidency, Genevieve was as supportive as ever.

With the presidential campaign behind them, Felix rededicated himself to Beauchamp Law, and he and Genevieve oversaw the opening of new branches in every corner of the globe. Genevieve remained as supportive and front-facing as always, and became Felix's personal representative, traveling all over the world to all of Beauchamp Law's various branches to check in on things. While this new lifestyle separated Genevieve from Amelia, she continued to chat with her on the phone and ensured that her children [[Connor Beauchamp|Connor]] and [[Elise Beauchamp|Elise]] helped out when Amelia needed it.

## Personality
A woman in a relentless pursuit of perfection, Genevieve knows how to keep things operating smoothly. She knew [[Felix Beauchamp|Felix]] was the one early on, and ensured that they were perfect matched and, most importantly, on speaking terms. She guided [[Beauchamp Law]] towards success, and managed all of its employees at first without having any education in law.

This desire for perfection is also reflected in her personal life- she keeps it entirely separate from her work life, as she believes it could lead to messes. She also expects perfection from those around her, which has been something that was frustrated Felix from time to time as he recognizes that he is far from perfect. Regardless, once someone has entered Genevieve's personal life, she treats them as a friend for life, and will do anything to ensure that their life and friendship remains unblemished.
