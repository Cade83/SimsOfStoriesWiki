**Beauchamp Law** is a location and workplace in [[Courage & Resolve]]. A law firm operated by [[Felix Beauchamp|Felix]] and [[Genevieve Beauchamp]],  Beauchamp Law grows to become one of the most well recognized law firms worldwide.

## Profile
Originally founded by [[Felix Beauchamp]] with the goal of making the law more transparent and fair, Beauchamp Law struggled to find its footing at first. At the time [[Amelia Brown]] and [[Stefan Barrens]] were hired, the company was desperate enough that they were hiring anyone who applied with any amount of law experience. When Beauchamp Law started to see some early success, they tried to expand too early, and were forced to law off a significant number of staff members. The company also wasn't aided by Felix's refusal to show his face in public, with [[Genevieve Beauchamp]] always acting as his proxy.

After Amelia was forced to humiliate both Stefan and the company for the way she'd been treated, Felix had to show his face, and from then on, the company was on the up. Beauchamp Law went worldwide, opening offices in cities as far off as [[San Myshuno]]. This level of success was hugh enough that Felix was able to use it as a platform during his run for [[President|president]].
