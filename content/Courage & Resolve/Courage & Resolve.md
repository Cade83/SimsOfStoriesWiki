### Chapter 2: Strength of Will
>*After Samson's sudden end, Amelia struggles to deal with the strange feeling of loss she now feels, constantly remembering back to her past with him.  She also attempts to remain on friendly terms with Carter, her brand her neighbor who has a dark past of his own, despite his role in Samson's death and unusual line of work. Cory and Jamira slowly begin to navigate the maze that is young adult life, even if it sometimes puts them at odds with Amelia or each other.*
