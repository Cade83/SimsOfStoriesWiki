## Profile

> Nayte and Maeth are brought into creation.

Nayte and his younger brother [[Maeth Stil|Maeth]] were created from stardust when their parents, [[Charise]] and [[Marit]], wanted to try to have a family in an effort to bring each other closer together. Both children inherited their parents ideals, with Nayte inheriting more of Marit's and being more rebellious as a result. Having a family didn't stop their arguments, however, and they decided that once their children were old enough, they would demand that they settle their millennia long battle over conflicting ideals.

> Nayte places a neutral crown upon his head.

As the son who ended up older due to Marit's influence on him, Nayte was asked to decide between the ideals of his parents. Nayte, who had grown up seeing the arguments of his parents and watched the universe they had created function just fine with both of their ideals in place, chose to side with neither. He placed a crown that featured neither of their respective gems upon his head, signifying his neutrality. His parents began to fight, and told Maeth that he would have to make the decision in Nayte's place.

> Charise curses her children.

Nayte spoke to Maeth about his choice, and Maeth, as the obedient child who had inherited the ideals of Charise, was unable to decide between both of his parents. Nayte spoke to their parents on Maeth's behalf, and told them that neither child would make that choice for them. Charise and Marit went down to their world to settle things in combat, and only Charise returned. Upon her return, she chose to enter a long rest, and part of that rest involved taking her children to her world, giving them human identities, and leaving them to live out an endless series of perfect lives. From that day on, throughout each of his many lives, Nayte believed he was William Cedar.
