## Profile

> Nayte and Maeth are brought into creation.

Maeth and his younger brother [[Nayte Stil|Nayte]] were created from stardust when their parents, [[Charise]] and [[Marit]], wanted to try to have a family in an effort to bring each other closer together. Both children inherited their parents ideals, with Maeth inheriting more of Charise's and being more obedient as a result. Having a family didn't stop their arguments, however, and they decided that once their children were old enough, they would demand that they settle their millennia long battle over conflicting ideals.

> Nayte speaks to Charise and Marit for Maeth.

As the younger son, Maeth wasn't initially asked to make the choice between the ideals of his parents. When Nayte refused to pick either side, however, Charise and Marit came to Maeth and told him that he would have to make that decision in Nayte's stead. Nayte spoke to Maeth about his task, and Maeth told him that he didn't want to side with one parent over the other. Nayte conveyed this to their parents on Maeth's behalf.

> Charise curses her children.

Left with no other options, Charise and Marit went down to their world to settle things in combat, and only Charise returned. Upon her return, she chose to enter a long rest, and part of that rest involved taking her children to her world, giving them human identities, and leaving them to live out an endless series of perfect lives. From that day on, throughout each of his many lives, Maeth believed he was Delmore Cedar.
