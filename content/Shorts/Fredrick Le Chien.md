## Profile

> Fredrick and Mabel.

Fredrick's father founded the Le Chien Legacy and raised Fredrick to one day inherit his title. Fredrick courted and married [[Mabel Le Chien|Mabel]], a fellow young socialite, and their marriage was the talk of [[Windenburg]], further increasing their family's legacy and influence. When Fredrick's father passed, there was so much news that it reached the ears of [[Bernard Escargot Shallot IV|Lord Bernard Escargot Shallot IV]] and [[Mimsy Alcon Shallot|Lady Mimsy Alcon Shallot]] in mainland Windenburg. Recognizing the Le Chien's influence, they invited them over for a dinner at their [[Von Haunt Estate|estate]].

Fredrick and Mabel had been led to believe that the Shallots had a Legacy of their own, and they feared potential conflict. Regardless, they attended the dinner and had a fabulous time. Mabel, however, had doubts. She believed that the Shallots were plotting against them. Together, Fredrick and Mabel cooked up a scheme to weave an illusion of friendship and bring an end to this rival Legacy before they could bring an end to theirs.

> Fredrick and Mabel speak with Newton.

Fredrick befriended Bernard, with the two of them often drinking late into the night. He also helped Mimsy in her garden on occasion and while out in the yard, he got to know the Shallot's gardener [[Newton Addington]]. Fredrick and Mabe; got close with Newton, and eventually, they were able to sway him into turning a blind eye while they built a secret room beneath the elaborate hedge maze he maintained.

> The Le Chiens enact their plan.

Over the following year, Fredrick and Mabel worked on completing their secret room. They also tracked down a [[Agatha Horton|witch]] and purchased potions from her that they could use to set the Shallot Mansion ablaze. When Bernard admitted to Fredrick that he'd come to fear the level of influence the Le Chien family commanded, Fredrick leapt into action. He and Mable went to their secret room and finally began to put their plan into action.

Mable argued that Mimsy was innocent, but her words were too little too late. As the Shallot Estate erupted in flames, Fredrick and Mabel were immediately filled with regret. Regardless, they knew they had to keep up their narrative. They told their son that they'd done what they had to protect themselves and this became a story that was passed down in the Le Chien family for generations.
