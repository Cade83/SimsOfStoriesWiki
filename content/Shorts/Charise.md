## Profile

> Charise creates the universe.

In the beginning of everything, Charise created the world. She designed the world according to her ideals- aesthetic perfection and harmony of all. During this time, she would regularly walk among her people, hear their wishes, and improve upon her already perfect creation to ensure that all of her creations were happy. The people began to call her the Mother.

> Charise and Marit argue.

As Charise observed her perfect creation from afar, she became bored. Everything went as she had designed, yet that also meant that all was perfectly monotonous. She vanished for a time, and returned with [[Marit]], who was known as the Father for a time. As he observed the world he created, Marit came to the same realization that Charise had- that things were boring, nobody was ever able to achieve anything, and that every day and family were the same. When he brought those issues to Charise, she refused to budge, as, in her mind, bringing Marit into her life was how she'd remedied things. Marit began to adjust things behind her back, and when Charise noticed, the two fought, and in their attempt to change their world, Charise's perfect creation exploded.

> Nayte and Maeth are brought into creation.

Charise and Marit made a truce, and constructed a new world together that embodied both of their ideals. They sealed some of their power into gems that they wore on their circlets, and tried to sit back. Arguments still arose, however, and in an effort to bring each other together, they followed the example of their creations, took on names of their own, and created [[Nayte Stil|Nayte]] and [[Maeth Stil]] as their children. While both children had elements of each of them, Nayte took after Marit, and Maeth after Charise. Charise and Marit decided that when their children were old enough, they would chose which sets of ideals were superior, and that would finally end their millennia long argument.

> Charise and Marit fight in front of Nayte.

Nayte, who reached maturity before Maeth, told his parents that the world functioned best with neither of their ideals reigning superior. True perfection came from a perfect balance. Charise and Marit flew into a rage, and began to fight worse than they ever had before. To avoid destroying this world, they removed themselves for a time, telling Nayte than upon their return, Maeth would have to choose. Maeth ultimately refused to choose as well. Furious at each other for having settled on using children as their answer, Charise and Marit returned to their world to settle things once and for all, as on solid ground, they were mortal.

> Charise makes preparations.

 Charise triumphed over Marit, and Marit vanished from the pages of history. With Marit gone, Charise decided that it was time for her to rest for a very long time. Her first order of business was taking her children to the world she created and giving them false identities. They would live out boring little perfect lives until the day she returned, unaware that they had once been her children, and she was sure that upon her awakening, they would see her truth. This solution also kept them from ruining her world as Marit had. Just in case, however, she set up a method for her children to awaken her. Her final gift to her people before her eternal rest was a scroll, which came to be known as the Blessed Scroll, containing 8 fundamentals for her people to aspire to in her absence.
1. Have Compassion for Those Less Fortunate
2. Judgement Comes For All
3. Interior Beauty is Just as Important as Exterior
4. Respect Other's Ideals
5. Love Must be Taken at it's Purest Form
6. A Union of Two Souls Must only Exist if the Love is True
7. Humility is Crucial
8. Constant Reflection is Important for Day to Day Lifeâ€‹

#### Legacy
With Charise having returned to her realm and entered her eternal sleep, the faithful she'd left her Blessed Scroll were responsible for spreading her teachings. They erected churches to honor her, and taught all about her 8 fundamentals, but much of her actual life story was kept under wraps. Her cursed children continuing to roam the earth and her arguments with Marit didn't paint her in the best light, and they wanted her followers to believe that following the Mother's teachings resulted in perfection, not potential mistakes.
