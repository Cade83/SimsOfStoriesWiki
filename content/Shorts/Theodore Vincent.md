## Profile

> Theodore practicing magic.

In his youth, Theodore studied magic under [[Agatha Horton]] and her husband. He displayed a particular affinity for practical magic, which Agatha's husband specialized in, so he chose to pursue that path. Theodore developed a basic mastery then went back to his life, where he ran a [[Witch of the Grey's Bar|small bar]] deep in the concrete jungle of [[San Myshuno]]. He enjoyed socializing with patrons and going bowling nearby and only really used his magic talents for small, practical things that helped keep the bar running.

> Theodore accepts the position of head witch.

One day, Theodore was approached by all three head witches at the time: Agatha, [[Rebekah Gossett]], and [[Elaine Oldham]]. They told him he was the candidate for the position of Head of Practical Magic, and invited him to the [[Witch of the Sands's Oasis]]. Theodore believed it to be an interview for a position he was ill-suited for, but Agatha insisted that he was the *only* candidate they were considering. Nervous, Theodore hastily accepted. The three witches warned him to be more careful about what he agreed to in the future. That night. Theodore stripped naked under the light of the full moon and prepared for his new life. As a new head witch, the next youngest, Elaine, dedicated herself to helping him in his first years and the two of them became good friends.

## Personality
Theodore greatly enjoyed his original life. He chatted up [[Witch of the Grey's Bar|bar]] patrons, hit up the bowling ally, then went home and enjoyed peace and quiet. The idea of being seriously considered as a head witch was completely ludicrous to Theodore- he did nothing remarkable ever, and he preferred that. Regardless, becoming an immortal head witch was too good of an offer to refuse, so he hastily agreed without hearing any of the conditions.

As a head witch, Theodore appreciates the perks, but he seriously misses the life he used to live.
