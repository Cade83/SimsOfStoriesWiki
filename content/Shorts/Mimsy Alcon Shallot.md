> Bernard and Mimsy at their estate.

Mimsy, directly descended from [[Windenburg]]'s previous nobility, was betrothed to [[Bernard Escargot Shallot IV|Lord Bernard Escargot Shallot IV]] at a young age. Bernard was from a family with ties to the Windenburg's previous royal family, with their union bringing prosperity to each of their families. Once Bernard's parents passed, he and Mimsy inherited his family's fabulous [[Von Haunt Estate|estate]], which was envied by all of Windenburg.

> Bernard rages at Mimsy.

As Windenburg fell into an economic crisis, the Shallot's fortunes turned. Bernard, who painted for a living, typically sold his work for exorbitant amounts. With the economy as it was, his usual buyers were unable to afford his paintings so he was forced to continue lowering his prices. All of this enraged Bernard and he would take his anger out on Mimsy and his servants.

> Mimsy confides in Newton.

Mimsy would frequently flee into the grounds of the estate, where their gardener, [[Newton Addington]], maintained an elaborate hedge maze and she kept a small garden herself. Once in the maze, she'd often run into Newton and confide in him about just how scared she was of Bernard these days. Newton wanted to help the Shallots, and eventually, news of [[Fredrick Le Chien|Fredrick]] and [[Mabel Le Chien]] reached him. They had managed to accumulate new wealth despite the state of the economy. Mimsy sent them an invitation for dinner and the four of them enjoyed a wonderful evening together. The Le Chiens' fortune was merely a stroke of luck, but they expressed interest in purchasing Bernard's paintings and the four of them became good friends.

> Mabel walks in on Bernard and Mimsy.

Mimsy grew close with Mabel in particular, almost revealing just how bad her situation with Bernard was on several occasions. There was a day where Mabel walked in on Bernard berating Mimsy and she chose to personally intervene, infuriating Bernard. Bernard told them to never set foot on his estate again. Luckily for Mimsy and the Le Chiens, Mimsy's garden matured and she was able to sell just enough for the Shallots to keep themselves afloat. Bernard's anger abated, and the Le Chiens were allowed to return.

> Mimsy compliments Bernard's final painting.

Unknown to the Shallots was the fact that the Le Chiens were plotting on their downfall. After a negative interaction with Fredrick, Bernard angrily painted and produced something he hated. Mimsy complimented the painting and Bernard, believing that she was lying to him, threw the painting into the fireplace in a rage. This spark ignited the Le Chiens' trap, and the Shallots went up in flames along with the rest of their estate.
