**Elaine Oldham** is one of four head witches. She has domain over [[Willow Creek]] and its surrounding area.

## Profile
Before Elaine became a head witch, she lived quietly in the bayou near what would one day be [[Willow Creek]] in a [[Witch of the Willow’s Swamp|home]] she built herself. She tended to her plants, crafted a few potions, and rarely ever interacted with the individuals in town. Despite her solitude, individuals sought her out when they needed a potion to remedy their problems, colloquially dubbing her the 'Witch of the Willow'. Both Elaine and Willow Creek itself were titled at around the same time in history, their names coming from the willow trees in the area.

When approached by [[Agatha Horton]], [[Rebekah Gossett]], and Agatha's husband, the three head witches at the time, who offered her the position of Head Witch of Alchemy, Elaine initially turned down them down. She had no desire to change the life she'd been living. She had to be promised that not much would change in her life before she accepted their offer. As Head Witch of Alchemy, not much changed for Elaine, as promised. She occasionally had to mentor fellow witches in alchemy but her ability to tend to her plants and occasionally help out a citizen of Willow Creek in need never changed. With her new powers, Elaine began to survey the people in the area she was responsible for with a scrying spell. She wanted to be knowledgable.

This was Elaine's only focus, however, so when asked to contribute to bigger tasks, such as finding a new head witch, she had nothing to offer. Agatha was disappointed and told Elaine to do better, but she'd already selected the perfect candidate anyway. Elaine promised to get more involved to be a better example to the new head witch, [[Theodore Vincent]], now that she'd no longer be the youngest. Elaine, Agatha, and Rebekah all met up with Theodore and performed the ritual that granted him the powers of a head witch. As the youngest, Elaine dedicated herself to helping guide Theodore in his early years, and the two became fast friends.

## Personality
Elaine is very much a solitary woman. She lives [[Witch of the Willow’s Swamp|deep in the bayou]] for a reason- she does not want to be disturbed. When discovered by the average person, she insists that she wants to be left alone unless they know exactly who she is and need her help. That doesn't mean that Elaine doesn't care, however. Far from it, she's kind and even jokes about the depths of her power. Elaine wants to do all she can to help those in need, she just needs to be encouraged first, such as what happened with [[Theodore Vincent|Theodore]].

Elaine's help does have limits. She operates by a strict moral code, and if she deems someone to be unworthy, her kind demeanor fades. When Elaine has doubts, she tests an individual to determine the purity of their intentions and soul. It's their last chance to prove themselves, and if they fail, such as [[Ellen Bowers]] did, they will never be able to locate Elaine again.
