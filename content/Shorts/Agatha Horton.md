**Agatha Horton** is one of four head witches. The oldest of the four, she has domain over [[Brindleton Bay]] and its surrounding area.

## Profile
Agatha's reign as a head witch stretches back centuries. She's seen the rise and fall of many a nation and is a survivor of the witch wars that caused the fall of many of her fellow head witch predecessors and successors. While she'd gotten used to observing, there came a point where she felt a genuine connection to a certain Head Witch of Practical Magic. He swept her off her feet, and the two of them were soon wed. For a glorious couple centuries, she and her husband tutored younger witches side by side and tried their best to parent [[Rebekah Gossett]], a problematic head witch who'd been given too much responsibility too young. Regardless of Rebekah, Agatha saw it as a golden age of witches.

> Agatha gathers her fellow head witches.

Unfortunately for Agatha, her husband's power and influence began to go to his head. He began to disobey the witch laws that Agatha had personally enforced since time immemorial. She warned him on numerous occasions, hoping he'd desist, but he continued to imbue mortals with magical energy to shape them in his image. Ultimately, Agatha chose the law over love and personally oversaw the excommunication and execution of her husband then destroyed his soul to prevent a potential resurrection. With all of that said and done, she gathered Rebekah and [[Elaine Oldham]]- her fellow head witches- and began discussion about her husband's replacement.

> The head witches meet with Theodore.

Agatha routinely surveys fellow witches through an enchanted mirror in her [[Witch of the Waves's Mansion|mansion]], so she was able to come to the meeting with the one candidate she believed was suited for the role- one [[Theodore Vincent]]. Agatha and her husband had personally trained the boy as well. With neither Rebekah or Elaine bringing much of value to the table, the three of them met with Theodore. Once he agreed to become the next head witch, the three of them all performed the ceremony that granted Theodore the power and immortality that came with being a head witch.

## Relationships
Due to her age and experience, Agatha commands respect wherever she goes, and her power level matches. She's a very no-nonsense woman, refusing to tolerate jokes and jabs, which has put her at odds with [[Rebekah Gossett|Rebekah]] for centuries. Agatha tends to ignore her, but in previous years, the two of them got into heated arguments.

Being emotionless is something Agatha has mastered. Outside of Rebekah, her husband was the one individual who was able to wear down Agatha's walls. He truly connected with her, and she loved him in turn. However, as much as she loved him, Agatha had personally written the witch laws after the witch wars, and him choosing to break them put what she believed in in conflict with her heart. Unsurprisingly, her mind won out, and she removed her husband. Agatha buried the feelings that arose from doing that deed deep and once again buried herself in her duties.
