> Fredrick and Mabel.

Mabel grew up as a socialite in the upper echelons of [[Windenburg]] society. Not long after she came of age, she met [[Fredrick Le Chien]], their heir of a budding Legacy family. He courted her and eventually asked for her hand in marriage. Mabel happily accepted and soon found herself and Fredrick to be the talk of the town. Once Fredrick's father passed, the spotlight was truly on the two of them, even reaching the ears of [[Bernard Escargot Shallot IV|Lord Bernard Escargot Shallot IV]] and [[Mimsy Alcon Shallot|Lady Mimsy Alcon Shallot]] in mainland Windenburg.

> The Le Chiens attend dinner with the Shallots.

The Shallots invited the two of them to dinner at their [[Von Haunt Estate|estate]] to celebrate their newfound prominence in society. Mabel and Mabel had been led to believe that the Shallots had a Legacy of their own, and they feared potential conflict. Regardless, they attended the dinner and had a fabulous time. Mabel, however, had doubts. She believed that the Shallots were plotting against them. Together, Fredrick and Mabel cooked up a scheme to weave an illusion of friendship and bring an end to their rival Legacy before the Shallots could bring an end to theirs.

> Mabel bonds with Mimsy and Newton.

Mabel befriended Mimsy, spending time socializing with her in public assisiting her with her garden. While out on the grounds, Mabel got to know the Shallot's gardener [[Newton Addington]]. Mabel and Fredrick got close with Newton, and eventually, they were able to sway him into turning a blind eye while they built a secret room beneath the elaborate hedge maze he maintained.

> The Le Chiens enact their plan.

Over the following year, Fredrick and Mabel worked on completing their secret room. They also tracked down a [[Agatha Horton|witch]] and purchased potions from her that they could use to set the Shallot Mansion ablaze. Throughout this year, Mabel grew close to Mimsy and began to sympathize for her. Mabel saw that Mimsy only suffered in her marriage to Bernard, and came to believe that if the Shallots were plotting against them, Mimsy played no part in it. Fredrick, however, came to believe the opposite and he rushed them to their secret room one night, believing that the time was right.

> The Shallot Estate burns.

Mable argued that Mimsy was innocent, but her words were too little too late. As the Shallot Estate erupted in flames, Mabel and Fredrick were immediately filled with regret. Regardless, they knew they had to keep up their narrative. They told their son that they'd done what they had to protect themselves and this became a story that was passed down in the Le Chien family for generations.
