## Profile
Newton served as [[Bernard Escargot Shallot IV|Lord Bernard Escargot Shallot IV]] and [[Mimsy Alcon Shallot|Lady Mimsy Alcon Shallot]]'s personal gardener for several years. Bernard and Mimsy gave Newton room and board, while he was tasked with tending to the grounds of the [[Von Haunt Estate|Shallot Estate]]. He personally developed the hedge maze that the estate became so famous for.

As the Shallot family's finances declined and Bernard grew increasingly unpleasant, Newton kept his ear to the ground in an attempt to help. He eventually heard of the Le Chien family, who had accumulated wealth and influence despite economic turmoil. He brought news of them to Mimsy, who invited them to dinner, eager to bend their ear.

Bernard and Mimsy befriended [[Fredrick Le Chien|Fredrick]] and [[Mabel Le Chien]], Newton got to know them as well. At one point, the Le Chiens offered Newton a significant sum of money to turn a blind eye as they constructed something deep within his maze. Newton agreed to their terms, but he investigated what the two of them were up to in secret. He was eventually able to locate it, but he was unable to get inside. When the Shallot Estate erupted in flames a year after the Le Chiens had gotten involved, Newton knew exactly who to blame. Unfortunately for him, however, the two of them had far too much influence, so he could do nothing to implicate them.
