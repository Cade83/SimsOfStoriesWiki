**Rebekah Gossett** is one of four head witches. She has domain over [[Oasis Springs]] and its surrounding area.

## Profile
Rebekah was selected to be a head witch at the age of 10. It was a dark time for witches, with many at each others throats, and head witches rose and fell in months. The one constant was [[Agatha Horton]], who was arguably one of the most powerful witches at the time but she chose not to display that unless absolutely necessary. Agatha stumbled across Rebekah and witnessed her capabilities firsthand when she vanished all the water in a river and snapped the bridge that crossed it, halting the advance of Agatha's pursuers. Agatha whisked Rebekah away and had the head witches at the time perform the ascension ritual for Rebekah.

As Rebekah grew up, times improved, and she found herself as the first ever child head witch. It was a level of power and influence that went to Rebekah's head. She could do near anything she wanted and most importantly of all, she didn't have to mature. Her [[Witch of the Sands's Oasis|home]] is straight out of a child's fantasy. Recognizing that Rebekah was becoming a problem, Agatha tried her best to act as a psuedo-mother to her and eventually tasked her with being the keeper of knowledge. Rebekah's home became a place visited by witches from all four schools of magic, and she had to be knowledgable enough to direct them. Rebekah hated being seen as unintelligent, so Agatha's plan worked.

While Rebekah had learned responsibility, she wasn't pleased with Agatha. She recognized that she was duty-bound, however, so she showed up to do her part when [[Elaine Oldham]] ascended to the role of head witch and let Agatha bulldoze her and gave in when she insisted that [[Theodore Vincent]] needed to meet the three head witches at her home. Rebekah enjoyed terrorizing Elaine and Theodore a bit, as she knew she represented mischief, but she always fulfilled her duties.

## Personality
Rebekah grew up as a spoiled child and that attitude over to her adult life. She expects to get anything she wants and demands a level of respect that is rarely ever reciprocated by others. [[Agatha Horton|Agatha]] has done her best to instill a sense of responsibility in Rebekah which does afford her some level of respect. She's incredibly knowledgable and handles things that need to be taken care of, but her bratty demeanor works against her. 

Rebekah also has a mean streak running a mile rude. She relishes in making off color jokes and insulting others. If she has a thought, she expresses it, as she completely lacks any filters. The witches she mentors generally come to fear her.
