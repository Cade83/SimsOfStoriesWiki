## Profile

> Marit and Charise.

Marit was brought in to assist [[Charise]] with running her universe, as she'd grown bored of the monotony that her perfection inflicted on the denizens of her world. While Charise actually brought Marit in to distract herself, Marit believed that he was meant to help correct what he saw as incorrect with her world. He found her supposedly perfect method of running things to be boring- he valued power, strength of body and mind, and the ability to achieve things with hard work. With everything being equal and achievement being impossible, every person in Charise's world with virtually identical.

> Marit analyzes Charise's world.

Marit began to make small changes to Charise's world to bring things more inline with his values. He liked what he was seeing, and began to be a lot bolder with what he was adding. When Charise found out, she was enraged. She tried to put things back how they were, while Marit pushed his most extreme ideas onto Charise's world, and all of that pressure resulted in that perfect world exploding.

> Marit and Charise speak to Nayte.

Marit and Chrise made a truce, and constructed a new world together that embodied both of their ideals. They sealed some of their power into gems that they wore on their circlets, and tried to sit back. Arguments still arose, however, and in an effort to bring each other together, they followed the example of their creations, took on names of their own, and created [[Nayte Stil|Nayte]] and [[Maeth Stil]] as their children. While both children had elements of each of them, Nayte took after Marit, and Maeth after Charise. Marit and Charise decided that when their children were old enough, they would chose which sets of ideals were superior, and that would finally end their millennia long argument.

> Marit is defeated by Charise.

Nayte, who reached maturity before Maeth, told his parents that the world functioned best with neither of their ideals reigning superior. True perfection came from a perfect balance. Marit and Chise flew into a rage, and began to fight worse than they ever had before. To avoid destroying this world, they removed themselves for a time, telling Nayte than upon their return, Maeth would have to choose. Maeth ultimately refused to choose as well. Furious at each other for having settled on using children as their answer, Marit and Charise returned to their world to settle things once and for all, as on solid ground, they were mortal. Marit vanished from history after that battle, and it's widely believed that he perished.

#### Legacy
Records of Marit end after his fateful battle with Charise, not that many records of him exist in the first place. The faithful who were tasked with spreading the word of Charise chose to bury the less appealing parts of Charise's life, and many of her arguments with Marit are among them. While they don't outright deny his existence, according to the church, the Father was a foreboding figure who threatened the peace the Mother had given them, and she quickly subdued him to protect her creations.
