> Bernard and Mimsy at their estate.

Bernard, descended from the old royals of [[Windenburg]]'s past, was betrothed to [[Mimsy Alcon Shallot|Lady Mimsy Alcon Shallot]] at a young age. Mimsy was from another prominent family with ties to Windenburg's nobility, with their union bringing prosperity to each of their families. Once Bernard's parents passed, he inherited his family's fabulous [[Von Haunt Estate|estate]], which was envied by all of Windenburg.

As Windenburg fell into an economic crisis, the Shallot's fortunes turned. Bernard was a painter by trade and in better times, his work sold for exorbitant amounts. With the economy as it was, his usual buyers were unable to afford his paintings so he was forced to continue lowering his prices. All of this enraged Bernard and he would take his anger out on Mimsy and his servants.

Bernard's gardener, [[Newton Addington]], suggested that the Shallots meet with [[Fredrick Le Chien|Fredrick]] and [[Mabel Le Chien]], who had managed to accumulate new wealth despite the state of the economy. Mimsy sent them an invitation and the four of them enjoyed a wonderful evening together. The Le Chiens' fortune was merely a stroke of luck, but they expressed interest in purchasing Bernard's paintings and the four of them became good friends. Bernard and Fredrick frequently drank late into the night, talking about any number of things.

Unknown to the Shallots was the fact that the Le Chiens were plotting on their downfall. After one fateful day where Bernard told Fredrick that he'd come to fear the level of influence of the Le Chien family, as he now believed it may one day eclipse his, Fredrick put his plan in motion. Frustrated that Fredrick hadn't taken his compliment, Bernard angrily painted and produced something he hated. Mimsy complimented the painting and Bernard, believing that she was lying to him, threw the painting into the fireplace in a rage. This spark ignited the Le Chiens' trap, and the Shallots went up in flames along with the rest of their estate.
